# 28 · Current status

Where the project stands as of **16 August 2026**. Written to be read by someone
deciding whether to trust it, so the uncomfortable numbers come first.

## 28.1 · The four numbers that matter most

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **`[M-ext]` claims** | **0 of 30** | Nothing measured against an external reference |
| **Gates that ever veto** | **1 of 3** | Physical 149, statistical 0, deterministic 0 across 2,800 fault-suite ticks |
| **Benchmarks that will not run** | **0 of 17** | `whiteness` refused until its guard was narrowed on 16 Aug; it runs and `E-107` still stands |
| **Faults where governance costs** | **1 of 6** | `lateral_noise`: governed peaks at 1.7179 m, L7b disarmed at 0.5854 m — both inside the ±1.75 m corridor |
| **Register** | **3 open** of 21 | 16 closed, 1 reclassified, 1 partly closed |
| **Quality gate** | **green** | 3,065 passed + 3 xfailed, re-run 16 Aug |

**Everything in this section was re-measured on 16 August 2026** by running the
gate and the benchmarks, not by reading a document. Where a re-run disagreed with
a recorded figure, the measured value is given and the correction is named.

**[INTERPRETATION]** Read together: the engineering discipline is in good shape
and the **evidence base is not**. A green gate over 169 files says the code does
what its tests say; it says nothing about whether the system works on a road.

## 28.2 · What exists and runs

### The nine layers — all built

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| L1 sensing | Built. Three-channel median fusion, residual monitor, per-modality `StreamHealth` from freshness |
| L2 estimation | Built. UKF, packed symmetric covariance, no NumPy in the kernel. Sigma points redrawn after process noise (ADR-0032) |
| L3 trust | Built |
| L4 proposal *(Core-A)* | Built. Constrained PPO policy |
| L5 twin | Built. PINN, one head per context (ADR-0019) |
| L6 statistical gate | Built — **and cannot currently fire** (OD-8) |
| L7a deterministic gate | Built. **Zero vetoes** across the fault suite; `[OPEN]` |
| L7b physical gate | Built. Carries all 149 vetoes, on one reason code |
| L8 fail-safe | Built. Two counters, four postures, capability withdrawal axis, health-level ceiling, per-modality decay |
| L9 arbitration | Built. Sole actuation authority |

### Supporting machinery

- **Audit** — `DecisionRecord` per tick, hash-chained JSONL, **schema v10**
- **Config** — no defaults for safety thresholds (A-4), `extra="forbid"`, config
  hash on every row
- **Composition root** — accepts a platform rather than *being* one (ADR-0034)
- **Explainer** — `astra explain`, 95.2% covered after shipping at 10.3%
- **Dashboard** and interactive fault injection
- **Benchmarks** — fault study, degradation table, whiteness, exchangeability,
  gate census, ablation, ASTRA-vs-raw-Core-A
- **Artefact pipeline** — `make artifacts` and `make artifacts-check`, the latter
  **driving** the artefacts rather than checking they exist

### The quality gate, in detail

**Re-run 16 August 2026, not quoted from a document:**

**3,065 passed + 3 xfailed** in 80.15 s · `ruff` clean · `mypy --strict`
**Success: no issues found in 169 source files** · `lint-imports`
**12 kept, 0 broken** · coverage **97.47%**, per-file floor **every file at or
above 80%** · `quality gate: PASSED`.

*Two figures corrected against `E-1` and `E-133`, which recorded 166 files and
97.56% on 15 August.*

The floor sits far below the aggregate deliberately: its job is to catch a module
with *no* tests, not to chase branches. It exists because `astra explain` shipped
at 10.3% behind a green aggregate gate (`E-123`).

## 28.3 · The three open register rows

### OD-8 — the live loop is not exchangeable with its corpus · **the blocker**

**Re-measured 16 August 2026** — `python -m benchmarks.exchangeability`:

| context | corpus range | live range | inside |
|---|---|---|---|
| `URBAN_CLEAR` | 3.8758 – 5.4312 | 3.3648 – 3.4083 | **0.0%** |
| `DEGRADED_SENSOR` | 0.0823 – 5.3990 | 3.2415 | `n=1` — too few to judge |

**Zero overlap**, and the live median of 3.3787 sits **13% below the corpus
minimum**. Survived the regeneration through both ADR-0032 and ADR-0033 with the
gap widened.

*An earlier draft of this section quoted `E-41`'s 6 August figures — live 1.156
against a `HIGHWAY_CLEAR` corpus minimum of 1.158 — as though they were current.
They were superseded by `E-159` on 15 August; the finding is the same and the
numbers are not.*

The thin `DEGRADED_SENSOR` row is the `E-161` guard working: one sample is
reported as one sample rather than as `100% inside`.

**Not fixable in-house** — the corpus and the loop are both things this project
wrote.

### OD-11 wall 3 — the process model cannot represent a differential-drive platform

Held as a **strict xfail**. L2 derives yaw rate from `a_lat / v` and refuses below
a minimum speed. *"Unlike walls 1, 2 and 4 it cannot be fixed by moving a
symbol."* Deferred by explicit decision.

### OD-11 wall 4 — the rename

Needs a genuine second **domain**, not a better car, plus a third regeneration.
Deferred by explicit decision.

### And one partly closed

**OD-9** — the common-cause estimate. One third closed: the health map bypasses L2,
and the frozen-IMU departure that was **4.199 m** when the defect was found
(`E-46`, 9 August) fell to **0.167 m** once the integrity counter was wired
(`E-88`, 11 August).

**Re-measured 16 August 2026, and it has moved again** — `python -m
benchmarks.fault_study`, on the redundant driven path ADR-0033 made the default:

| scenario | final \|dev\| | max est err | vetoes | ticks not NOMINAL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| control | 0.017 m | 0.132 m | 1 | 0 |
| `imu_dropout` | **0.062 m** | 0.174 m | 18 | 195 |
| `position_bias` | 0.017 m | 0.132 m | 1 | 0 |
| `position_drift` | 0.017 m | 0.132 m | 1 | 0 |
| `lateral_noise` | **1.307 m** | 0.167 m | **126** | 141 |

**And the dropout arm ends at a complete stop** — final speed **0.0000 m/s**. The
posture reads LIMP, not HALT, but the speed cap brings the vehicle to rest, so the
*effect* of a dark IMU is a stopped vehicle inside its lane.

**Three things in that table were not true a week ago.** The dropout now ends at
0.062 m rather than 0.167 m, because three channels outvote one frozen one.
`position_bias` and `position_drift` are now **indistinguishable from the
control** — the faults that used to end 0.931 m and 2.025 m out are simply gone.
And `lateral_noise` has become the worst arm, at 1.307 m with 126 vetoes.

**And one recorded claim no longer reproduces.** The escalation table gives
`imu_dropout` **DEGRADED +5, LIMP +15, HALT —, peak φ 40**. The counter *reaches*
its HALT threshold; the machine does **not** enter HALT — ADR-0030's health-level
ceiling maps a `DEGRADED` stream to a maximum posture of `LIMP`.

`E-88`'s *"HALT at +40"* was correct when it was measured on 11 August. The
ceiling landed on the 15th and **capped the response one posture shallower**, and
nothing in the ADR, the audit schema or the config hash records that it had done
so. Corrected here and in sections 04, 07, 13, 14, 17, 21, 23 and 26.

## 28.4 · The evidence base, honestly

| Marker | Count | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `[M-ext]` | **0 of 30** | Measured against an external reference |
| `[M-syn]` | most | Measured, in an environment this project wrote |
| `[M-code]` | several | A property of the code, tested |
| `[E]` | several | Argued from evidence |
| `[NOT DONE]` | some | Claimed and not built |

**Three retractions stand on the record**, all from 15 August: `E-143` (a 7.35×
figure from a vehicle with every tick vetoed and speed zero), `E-145`/`E-146` (a
missing-artefact claim from a truncated `ls`), `E-161` (`100% inside` from one
sample). Each produced a **guard**, not a note.

**One withdrawn contribution:** EnbPI, the paper's stated method. No ensemble was
ever built; `ensemble_size` was deleted from the schema.

## 28.5 · Decisions and documents

**34 ADRs.** The most recent five, all from this month:

| | |
|---|---|
| 0030 | The health level caps how far the posture may escalate |
| 0031 | Decay measures the duty cycle — the counter cancels out |
| 0032 | Sigma points are redrawn after process noise is added |
| 0033 | Redundancy is the driven path, not a measurement beside it |
| 0034 | The composition root accepts a platform instead of being one |

**10 separation invariants**, each with a stated enforcement kind **asserted by a
test** — because SI-6 was documented as review-only for four weeks after the code
changed.

**10 assumptions**, each with what breaks if it is wrong.

**Threat model** — including T1′ (two coordinated liars invert the monitor) and T4
(a compromised process, explicitly out of scope).

**Paper adherence** — seven disagreements between the paper and the code
documented; six specified but unapplied, because the paper is not in this
repository.

## 28.6 · What was completed most recently

The work between 11 and 16 August, in order:

1. **Capability withdrawal** (ADR-0029) — a second axis; 21 tests; provably
   additive, all 2,958 pre-existing tests untouched
2. **Health-level ceiling** (ADR-0030) — a high-water mark bounding escalation
3. **Sensor decay** (ADR-0031) — per-modality EMA converging to a fault's duty
   cycle, reported in every audit row, driving nothing
4. **ADR-0032** — the sigma-point redraw. Fixed a real filter defect, made two
   strict xfails flip to XPASS, and cost lane-keeping performance because the old
   filter was over-confident
5. **ADR-0033** — redundancy on the driven path. Repaid ADR-0032's cost with
   margin
6. **ADR-0034** — the composition root's platform seam
7. **Four new benchmarks** — degradation, whiteness, exchangeability, gate census
8. **Paper hygiene and the threat model**
9. **`docs/CARLA_PLAN.md`** and `docs/DATA_SPLIT_PROTOCOL.md`
10. **This A–Z knowledge base** — 29 of 31 sections at the time of writing

Schema version moved **8 → 9 → 10** across that work, each step forced to be a
deliberate decision by a test that has now fired seven times.

## 28.7 · What is deliberately *not* done

Distinguish **not yet** from **decided against**:

| | Status |
|---|---|
| Hardware | **Never.** Out of scope by design |
| FB2 twin adaptation | **Refused**, with a measurement — score fell 40% in an unchanging context |
| FB3 corpus self-calibration | **Refused**, with a measurement — veto rate converges to ε regardless of whether anything is wrong |
| FB4 | Unbuilt |
| Per-gate override list in config | **Refused** — would turn *"which gate may be overruled"* into a value a deployment can edit |
| Weighting modalities | **Refused** — nobody can defend *"the camera is worth 0.4 of an IMU"* |
| Certification artefacts | Not yet. ISO 26262 work item |
| Latency measurement | **Done** — full tick p99 **7.289 ms** against a 10 ms budget, max **57.063 ms**, 1 tick in 2,000 over budget (16 Aug) |
| A deadline monitor | **Not built.** Nothing distinguishes a late tick from a punctual one in the record |

## 28.8 · Honest summary in five sentences

The architecture is **complete and runs**, and its structural guarantees — the
trust boundary, the fail-closed merge, the refusal-not-repair rule, sole actuation
authority — are real and hold regardless of plant.

The **measurements are all internal**, and the plant, process model, twin and
corpus are the same bicycle model, so agreement between them is not evidence.

The statistical gate **cannot currently fire**, and the deterministic gate does not
fire either for reasons that are not yet understood, so one gate is carrying the
architecture.

The **engineering discipline is unusually strong** — executable invariants, a
schema pinned by a test, a per-file coverage floor, guards produced by every
retraction — and this is the part a company could use immediately.

The next step is not more internal work: it is **an environment this project did
not write**.
