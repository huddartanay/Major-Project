# The re-verification prompt

Paste the block below into a fresh session to re-verify this folder from scratch.
It is self-contained: environment quirks, the exact commands, the expected values,
and the traps that have already cost time.

**Re-run it whenever** the code changes, an ADR lands, or more than a week has
passed. Two ADRs once moved a headline safety number with nothing announcing it,
which is the whole reason this file exists.

**It proposes; it does not edit.** The verifying session writes its findings to a
new `CORRECTIONS.md` and changes nothing else. That separation is deliberate — a
session that measures *and* rewrites can quietly talk itself into agreeing with
the document, and there is then no artefact showing what disagreed. Applying the
corrections is a second, reviewed step.

**Related:** [`REPRODUCE.md`](REPRODUCE.md) is the same command list organised by
*result* rather than by run order — use it when you want one number, not the whole
sweep.

```
Re-verify the A-Z folder in this repository by RUNNING the code, not by reading
the documents the claims came from.

YOUR OUTPUT IS A FILE, NOT AN EDIT
Write A-Z/00_START_HERE/CORRECTIONS.md and change nothing else. Do NOT edit any
A-Z section, any file under docs/, or this prompt. Propose; do not apply.

If you find a defect in the CODE (a benchmark that refuses wrongly, a guard that
has gone stale, a crash), say so in CORRECTIONS.md under "Code defects" and still
do not fix it in this session. A measurement pass that also changes the thing
being measured cannot be audited.

THE RULE
Every quantitative claim in A-Z/ must trace to a command you ran in this session.
Never quote a figure from EVIDENCE.md, CREDIBILITY_MATRIX.md or any A-Z section as
verification of itself — those are what you are checking. If a number cannot be
reproduced, say so plainly and classify it (see the format below) rather than
softening it.

A zero is not automatically good news. A zero veto rate, a silent gate and a
benchmark that prints nothing all look like health.

ENVIRONMENT — getting this wrong wastes a lot of time
- The gate and every benchmark run ONLY in WSL2 Ubuntu. Windows Python lacks the
  dependencies.
- Use `wsl -d Ubuntu` explicitly. The default distro is docker-desktop and has no
  bash. The default user is already `astra`; do NOT pass `-u astra`, that user is
  not found.
- The WSL checkout is ~/astra. Edit on Windows, then sync:
    wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc "cd ~/astra && rsync -a --delete --exclude 'var/' --exclude '.git/' --exclude '.venv/' --exclude '__pycache__/' --exclude '.mypy_cache/' --exclude '.pytest_cache/' --exclude '.ruff_cache/' --exclude 'A-Z/' /mnt/c/Users/Dell/Documents/ASTRA/ ~/astra/"
- Exclude var/ from the sync. It holds the twin, corpus and policy, is gitignored,
  and a fresh clone has none of them.
- Write benchmark output under $HOME, not /tmp. WSL restarts wipe /tmp mid-session.
- Invoke benchmarks as `uv run python -m benchmarks.<name>`, never by path —
  `training` is deliberately not installed.
- Run WSL commands through PowerShell with double quotes. Single quotes via a
  bash-style tool get mangled.

STEP 0 — BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
  make artifacts-check
Must print "twin, corpus and policy present; the vehicle drives". Presence is not
the check; DRIVING is. Run `make artifacts` if it refuses — order is load-bearing,
the corpus is generated through the twin and the policy is trained against both.

STEP 0b — RUN THE LINT STAGES AGAINST THE COMMITTED STATE, NOT THE WORKING COPY
  git clone --branch <branch> /mnt/c/Users/Dell/Documents/ASTRA ~/checks/clone
  cd ~/checks/clone && <venv>/ruff format --check . && <venv>/ruff check .

**This step exists because the instruction above it hid half of a finding.** The
rsync excludes `A-Z/`, and `ruff format` is configured to format fenced code
blocks in markdown — so a verifier who lints the synced copy sees only the Python
failures and misses the markdown ones. On 17 August that reported two unformatted
files when the committed state had four.

More generally: **the working copy is not what shipped.** The gate can be green in
WSL and red on the branch if formatting was applied on one side of the rsync and
the commit came from the other. That is exactly what happened in `83a7983`. Lint
the clone; run the expensive stages wherever is convenient.

  `envelope` needs a log argument and refuses every log in var/ (all are audit
  schema v1; it needs v7+). To exercise it, drive a fresh log and call its main in
  the SAME process — the loop writes to a temp dir cleaned on exit.

  `detectors` has no main. It is a library; its output is the shadow-detector
  table inside fault_study.

THE ONE THING NO BENCHMARK PRINTS
The lateral_noise mechanism. To re-derive it, drive the lateral_noise scenario
from benchmarks.fault_study.SCENARIOS with an observer and read, per tick,
`record.issued.origin` TOGETHER WITH both command vectors — and report the maximum
delta PER AXIS PER ORIGIN, not the largest delta in the run.

Expected: RATE_LIMITED on 122 of 200 post-fault ticks with throttle and brake
deltas of exactly 0.000000 and a steer delta up to 0.011977; SPEED_CAPPED on 3
ticks (351, 352, 353) carrying the throttle 0 / brake 1.0 substitution.

Two wrong explanations of this arm came from reading the largest substitution in
the run and attributing it to the majority origin. Read them together or not at
all. And note that this establishes WHAT GOVERNS each tick, not what causes the
deviation — that is [OPEN].

TRAPS THAT HAVE ALREADY BITTEN — check each
- Field names. TickSample has NO estimated/true lateral fields, and
  ProposedCommand has no `proposed_command` — it is `.command`. The estimate is
  `record.fast_state.mean[1]` (position_y) and it is OPTIONAL, so handle None.
  Two probes silently returned nan before this was noticed. If anything returns
  nan or an empty result, STOP and introspect the object; do not report around it.
- EVIDENCE.md's E-152 and E-153 still cite `benchmarks.redundancy`, which does
  NOT produce their figures — it prints the shadow residual monitor.
  `benchmarks.arms` is the command that does. If those rows still cite the wrong
  one, that is a finding.
- Historical vs current. Figures from before 15 August 2026 were superseded by
  ADR-0032 (sigma-point redraw) and ADR-0033 (redundancy on the driven path), and
  ADR-0030's health-level ceiling changed the dropout escalation. Keep them as
  dated history; do not present them as current behaviour.
- Guards go stale like numbers. Check every refusal a benchmark raises for whether
  it is refusing the right thing. One guard spent a day blocking its own benchmark
  because a later ADR made a correct safety stop look like a dead loop.
- One run is not a tail statistic. tick_latency defaults to five runs for that
  reason; do not quote a max from a single run.

WHAT CANNOT BE VERIFIED — say so rather than implying coverage
- Historical figures whose defect is closed and cannot be reproduced: OD-1's
  2,883 m, OD-5's 1,508, OD-6's 99,808/100,000, OD-4's 2.9e6 m, FB2's 40%,
  FB3's 5.02%. Trace these to CREDIBILITY_MATRIX.md and label them history.
- Every [INTERPRETATION] in the folder. Those are arguments; running code says
  nothing about whether they are right. Do not list them as verified OR as
  unverified findings — they are a different kind of claim.

WRITE A-Z/00_START_HERE/CORRECTIONS.md IN THIS FORMAT

  # Corrections proposed — <date>
  Session ran <N> of the commands above. Gate: <result>.

  ## Summary
  <one paragraph: how many claims checked, how many reproduced, how many did
  not, and the single most consequential finding>

  ## Corrections
  ### C1 · <short title> — <STALE | WRONG | UNREPRODUCIBLE | OVERSTATED>
  - **File** A-Z/NN_SECTION/README.md:LINE
  - **Says** <quote the exact text>
  - **Measured** <the figure> via `<the exact command>`
  - **Class** STALE (superseded by a dated change) / WRONG (never true) /
    UNREPRODUCIBLE (no command produces it) / OVERSTATED (true but claims more
    than the measurement supports)
  - **Proposed text** <the replacement, written in the folder's voice, keeping
    the old figure as dated history where it was once true>

  ## Code defects
  <anything wrong with the code rather than the documents. Do not fix them here.>

  ## Reproduced exactly
  <a list, so the pass is auditable in both directions. A corrections file that
  only lists failures cannot be distinguished from a shallow pass.>

  ## Not verified this pass
  <what you did not run and why, including anything that timed out>

  ## Expected-values table
  <the full table above, updated to what you measured, ready to paste into
  VERIFY_PROMPT.md when these corrections are applied>

RULES FOR THAT FILE
- Quote the document text exactly. A correction a reader cannot locate is a
  claim, not a correction.
- Give the command for every measured figure. No command, no correction.
- Keep an old figure as dated history when it was true on its date. Most
  discrepancies here are staleness, not error, and deleting the old number
  destroys the audit trail.
- Rank the corrections by how much they should change a reader's view, not by
  the order you found them.
- If nothing needs correcting, still write the file with an empty Corrections
  section and a full "Reproduced exactly" list. A pass that finds nothing is a
  result and must leave the same evidence as one that finds something.
- Do not claim 100%. State the fraction you actually verified.
