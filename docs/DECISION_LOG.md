# ASTRA — Decision Log

**What this is.** One entry per decision that could reasonably have gone another
way: what forced it, what the options were, what each would have cost, which was
taken, and what the choice gave up. It is the index a reviewer, an assessor or a
new engineer reads first.

**What it is not.** It does not restate the ADRs — each entry links to the
record that carries the full argument. It does not restate `EVIDENCE.md` — a
number lives in exactly one place, and that place is the evidence log. What lives
*here* and nowhere else is the **shape of the choice**: the alternatives, their
trade-offs, and why the rejected ones were rejected.

**Why it exists as a separate document.** Twenty-four ADRs are twenty-four
correct answers to twenty-four questions nobody remembers asking. Read in
sequence they do not tell you what kind of project this is. Read as a table they
do: **most of the hard calls here were forced by a measurement that contradicted
a document**, and the pattern is more persuasive than any single entry.

## How to read the columns

| Column | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The measurement, defect or contradiction that made a decision necessary. If this column says "design", the entry is weaker — it means nobody had run into the problem yet |
| **Alternatives** | Every option that was actually weighed, best rejected one first |
| **Why this one** | The discriminating argument — not the benefits, the *reason the others lose* |
| **Gave up** | What the choice cost. An entry with an empty cell here is a decision that has not been thought about hard enough |

## Part 1 · The decisions that shaped the architecture

### D-1 · Nine layers, consolidated numbering — [ADR-0001](adr/0001-consolidated-layer-numbering.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The source documents number the layers three different ways; the paper's Figure 1 labels **three different components "Layer 6"** |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Adopt the paper's numbering — rejected, it is internally inconsistent. (b) Number by execution order — rejected, L7a and L7b are concurrent. (c) Consolidated L1–L9, split L7 into a/b |
| **Why this one** | It is the only numbering in which every layer has exactly one number and every number has exactly one layer. `ASTRA_LAYER_COUNT = 9` is asserted against the enum by an architecture test, so it cannot drift without the build failing |
| **Gave up** | The paper and the implementation now disagree, and the paper is the one that must change (`PAPER_ADHERENCE.md` §2.7) |

### D-2 · SI units via `NewType`, converted only at boundaries — [ADR-0007](adr/0007-si-units-via-newtype.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | Design. A speed cap in km/h and a speed in m/s are both `float` |
| **Alternatives** | (a) A units library (`pint`) — rejected, runtime cost on a 20 Hz hot path and a dependency in the kernel. (b) Naming conventions (`speed_mps`) — rejected, a convention is not a check. (c) `NewType` + explicit conversion helpers |
| **Why this one** | Zero runtime cost, and a mismatch is a **type error at build time** rather than a wrong number at run time |
| **Gave up** | Conversions must be written by hand, and `NewType` does not stop arithmetic between two different units — it stops *assignment*. The remaining gap is real |

### D-3 · Separation invariants as executable contracts — [ADR-0012](adr/0012-executable-separation-invariants.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | Design, and it is the decision the whole safety argument rests on |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Document the invariants and review against them — rejected; **this is what "SI-6 is REVIEW-only" meant, and it stayed wrong in a document for four weeks after the code changed**. (b) Assert them in tests only — partly taken (SI-6, SI-8). (c) A catalogue where each invariant declares its own enforcement kind, and a test asserts the correspondence |
| **Why this one** | `is_mechanically_enforced` returns `False` for exactly `REVIEW`, and a test asserts that correspondence — so an invariant **cannot be quietly downgraded and keep claiming a guarantee** |
| **Gave up** | Nothing checks that the ten are the *right* ten |

### D-4 · One-way Core-A → Core-B channel as a type error — [ADR-0012](adr/0012-executable-separation-invariants.md), SI-5

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The paper's AXI4-Lite argument: a compromised Core-A must not be able to read a verdict |
| **Alternatives** | (a) A process boundary — rejected as out of scope for a Python prototype. (b) A convention plus review — rejected, see D-3. (c) A capability pair: `ProposalWriter` exposes no read method, enforced additionally by an import contract |
| **Why this one** | A violation does not compile. Twelve `lint-imports` contracts back it up at the module level |
| **Gave up** | It protects against *code* that reads a verdict, not against a compromised process outside the type system |

---

## Part 2 · The decisions forced by a measurement

**This is the substantial part.** Every entry below exists because something was
run and the result contradicted what a document said.

### D-5 · A gate that cannot judge abstains; no path overrides a veto — [ADR-0016](adr/0016-exploration-may-not-override-a-deterministic-veto.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | **99,808 commands per 100,000 issued under a blocking verdict.** Bounded safe exploration was tested *before* the verdict, so in exploration the proposal was issued regardless of what the gates decided — and at the shipped operating point exploration was engaged almost always |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Keep the ordering, document it honestly — rejected: it makes the deterministic gate's authority conditional on a state the gate cannot observe, and with exploration permanently engaged *no* gate had authority over the actuators. (b) Swap the branches, no abstention — **strictly safer, and it deletes bounded safe exploration**, because an uncalibrated L6 vetoes every tick. Kept on record as the honest fallback. (c) Override only the STATISTICAL veto at issue time — the first draft; buys the same behaviour for a fifth of the effort and pays with a permanent exception to the unconditional veto. (d) A per-gate override list in configuration — rejected on sight: it turns "which gate may be overruled" into a value a deployment can edit. (e) Add `Verdict.ABSTAIN`, drop abstentions before the fail-closed merge, and test the verdict first |
| **Why this one** | The real defect was upstream of the ordering: **one condition had two owners.** "No profile covers this context" produced a veto from L6 and a narrowed envelope from L9, and the conflict was resolved by L9 ignoring L6. Abstention gives the condition one owner. The code already contained the argument — *"a gate that cannot make a statistical claim must not report that the proposal satisfied one"* — and it must not report that the proposal *violated* one either |
| **Gave up** | A command an uncalibrated L6 blocked before is now issued when L7a and L7b pass; **the verdict is no longer binary**, and two invariant statements had to be amended; audit schema 1 → 2; and abstention is a licence that must not spread — a gate abstaining because it was "uncertain" would be a fail-open mode wearing this record as cover |

### D-6 · A jerk veto yields the largest admissible step — [ADR-0017](adr/0017-rate-limited-approach-to-a-jerk-vetoed-proposal.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | A veto latch: a vehicle 1 m off centre needs ~21 ticks to correct, every one of them vetoed on jerk, so the correction could never complete |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Raise the jerk limit — rejected, it is a comfort/safety bound, not a tuning knob. (b) Issue zero steering on a jerk veto — the previous behaviour, and it is what latched. (c) Project the proposal onto the largest step the bound permits, in the direction asked for |
| **Why this one** | The veto is not overridden — the proposal is *not* issued; a different command is, admissible under the refusing bound **by construction**. Verified live: 347 `RATE_LIMITED` ticks in a 20,000-tick soak |
| **Gave up** | It did not stop the departure, because there were two latches. The second — L6 vetoing every correction that would bring the vehicle back inside corpus coverage — is still open as P0.3 |

### D-7 · One twin head per context, not a consolidation penalty — [ADR-0019](adr/0019-one-twin-head-per-context.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | **EWC was not selective at all.** Across λ from 0 to 10⁵ the ratio of forgetting to learning was constant to three significant figures. At λ=0 and λ=150, forgetting was 0.038972 and 0.038951 — identical to four decimals |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Tune λ higher — rejected by the measurement; the entry that proposed this guessed the penalty would bite around λ≈10¹² and it never bites. (b) Move the Fisher anchor to context boundaries ([ADR-0018](adr/0018-ewc-anchors-on-context-not-on-every-update.md)) — tried, and superseded in effect. (c) One output head per context |
| **Why this one** | It could not have worked: FB2 adapts a single 16→2 readout that both contexts use in full, so **there is no disjoint subspace for a Fisher-weighted penalty to protect**. EWC was a speed dial, not a consolidator. Per-context heads make forgetting structurally impossible — the test asserts `==`, not a tolerance |
| **Gave up** | Contexts no longer share representation, so nothing transfers between them. `ewc_lambda` and `adaptation_buffer` residue is still in comments and configuration |

### D-8 · FB2 estimates control effectiveness rather than regressing on commands — [ADR-0020](adr/0020-fb2-estimates-control-effectiveness.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | FB2 as specified would **disarm the statistical gate**: its only labels are the proposer's own commands, so the twin regresses onto the thing it exists to be independent of. Measured in shadow, the non-conformity score fell **40%** in a context where nothing changed, monotonically, still falling |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Wire FB2 as specified — refused. (b) Wire it with a divergence guard — rejected, the guard would be calibrated against the drift it is meant to stop. (c) Leave FB2 unwired and say so — acceptable, and weaker. (d) Replace the *target*: estimate the platform's control effectiveness `B` from executed outcomes |
| **Why this one** | A target of **measured physics** cannot drift toward the proposer the way a target of the proposer's commands must |
| **Gave up** | The reasoning is sound and it is not evidence, so it too went through the shadow harness — and there it reported **140.000 on every platform**, including plants whose true `B` was 112 and 168, because it was being fed the *filtered estimate*. Fed the raw measured response it tracks to within 1.7%. **It is still not wired**, and this entry is a decision about what FB2 should be, not a closed loop |

### D-9 · An ablation neutralises a gate; it never removes one — [ADR-0021](adr/0021-ablation-neutralises-a-gate-it-never-removes-one.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The need for a Phase 4 ablation study, and the risk it creates: an ablation produces evidence that looks *exactly* like a governed run's |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Make the gate constructor parameters optional — rejected: a pipeline with no gate becomes constructible, permanently, so that a study can run once. (b) A configuration flag read at the gate — rejected, it is a safety threshold a deployment can flip. (c) Keep the parameters required and supply a **transparent subtype** that runs, writes a verdict, and cannot block |
| **Why this one** | A pipeline with no gate stays unconstructible, and the profile is **stamped into every decision record** — because a certification artefact describing a system that was not running is the failure this exists to prevent. Positive control: disarmed gates still write a verdict, 0 of 2,800 in every governed row, 2,800 of 2,800 in every disarmed row |
| **Gave up** | More machinery than a flag, and `ABLATION_ENVIRONMENTS` restricts it to development and simulation — which is a guard a deployment could in principle edit |

### D-10 · Faults are injected at the sensor boundary — [ADR-0022](adr/0022-faults-are-injected-at-the-sensor-boundary.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | Design, and it is the decision that made every later finding possible |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Corrupt the state estimate directly — rejected: it tests the gates against a fault no sensor can produce, and skips the estimator, which is the component that turns out to matter most. (b) Corrupt the command — rejected, that is an actuator fault and a different threat. (c) Corrupt the published sensor payload, before L1 |
| **Why this one** | It is where a real fault enters, so the whole pipeline is under test rather than the half below the injection point. `FaultSpec` refuses an inert configuration, and `peak_absolute_error` is **measured, not requested** |
| **Gave up** | Nothing measurable. The injector is bit-identical to no injector when nothing is active, pinned by whole-trace equality rather than a tolerance — which is what makes a two-arm comparison possible at all |

### D-11 · The OOD counter freezes during bounded exploration — [ADR-0023](adr/0023-the-ood-counter-freezes-during-bounded-exploration.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | **The architecture's distinguishing sentence was false.** On a platform the twin was never fitted to, L8 counted the vetoes L9 had already responded to and drove the vehicle to a terminal HALT — weak acceleration at t398, weak brakes at t404, both at 0.00 m/s under an arbitrator still reporting `SAFE_EXPLORATION` |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Exempt L6 and L7b vetoes from the counter — rejected, `machine.py`'s own docstring forbids it: *"which gate vetoed is evidence for the log, not an input to the escalation policy"*. An escalation policy that weights gates differently is one that can be tuned to ignore the gate that keeps firing. (b) Raise `ood_threshold_halt` when exploring — rejected: it converts a structural contradiction into a tuning parameter whose only defensible value is "longer than the longest tunnel", which nobody knows. (c) Make HALT recoverable — rejected, and it is the tempting one: **a recoverable HALT is a LIMP with a frightening name**. (d) Fix OD-12 alone and file OD-13 — rejected on the measurement, see below. (e) Freeze the counter on *posture*, and route the exploration speed cap through the projector |
| **Why this one** | Conditioning on posture — a boolean the arbitrator already publishes on every record — keeps every gate's contribution identical and puts the exception where an auditor sees it on the tick it applied. **SI-3 is untouched**: what is suspended is escalation to a terminal posture, never a gate's authority to block |
| **Gave up** | A sustained fault arising *during* exploration would not escalate the posture either. Recorded as an accepted risk with an explicit instruction — *whoever closes OD-9 must revisit this record* — and **D-12 is that revisit** |

### D-11b · Why OD-13 was fixed in the same change

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The control arm: before halting, the weak-braking platform reached **23.43 m/s** against a calibrated 14.27, with **zero** ticks marked `SPEED_CAPPED`. The envelope computed a speed cap and `restricted_space` turned it into narrowed *channel* bounds, which limit throttle per tick and bound speed not at all |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Ship the counter freeze alone — **this is the one worth recording.** It would have replaced "stops unnecessarily" with "accelerates without bound", and been reported as a fix. The halt was the only thing arresting the acceleration. (b) Enforce the cap in L7a — rejected: L7a is a *veto* gate, so every tick above the cap would fall back rather than be clamped, which is OD-12 by another route. (c) Route the cap through the projector seam P2.1 built for the fail-safe cap |
| **Why this one** | The projector *alters* a command, which is what an envelope means, and `SPEED_CAPPED` keeps meaning **a command the cap altered** rather than a cap that existed |
| **Gave up** | The exploration cap and the fail-safe cap are indistinguishable in `CommandOrigin`. A third origin was considered and rejected — the cause is already on the same record in `arbitration.outcome`, and an enum that grows a member per cause stops being a classification |

### D-12 · Sensor integrity is a second counter, not a fourth gate — [ADR-0024](adr/0024-sensor-integrity-is-a-second-counter-not-a-fourth-gate.md)

**The most consequential decision in this log, and the one whose reasoning
transfers furthest.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | **OD-9.** Every Core-B gate reads L2's fast estimate and the proposer closes its loop on the same estimate, so a corrupted reading is *actively driven* toward the value the gates consider safe. A 200-tick IMU dropout put the vehicle **4.199 m off a 1.75 m lane** with the corridor bound reading **0.023 m** and a verdict trace **identical to the clean control's** |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **A fourth Core-B gate vetoing on stream health** — the obvious answer, and it does not work: L9's fallback controller reads the same corrupted estimate, so a veto exchanges one command computed from a lie for another. It also raises `CORE_B_GATE_COUNT`, which three architecture tests assert. (b) **Feed stream health into the existing OOD counter** — cheapest, and rejected three times over: it conflates two conditions in one integer so an auditor cannot tell which fired; it inherits thresholds that are too slow (HALT at 100 against a departure at 73); and **it would freeze during exploration**, which is exactly the risk D-11 accepted. (c) **Gate on the innovation sequence** — the *principled* candidate, and **refuted by measurement**: a 1 cm/tick drift against a 0.1 m sigma never leaves the filter's expected band, so it is silent on precisely the fault it was most wanted for. (d) **Gate on estimate uncertainty `trace(P_f)`** — rejected before it was built and written down so nobody tries it twice: a frozen reading is maximally *self-consistent*, so the filter grows **more** confident, not less. (e) **Reduce the Trust Index** — it already responds at the same +5 latency and it changed nothing, because nothing acts on trust alone; wiring it further would make the Trust Index no longer a conformal quantity and invalidate E-12's coverage arithmetic. (f) **Escalate only on a modality that has published at least once** — rejected: it silently tolerates a sensor **dead at boot**, the worst of the three to tolerate. (g) **Sensor redundancy and a cross-check** — *not rejected, deferred*: the only general answer, and unmeasurable on a plant that publishes one ground truth to all five modalities. (h) A second counter in L8, driven by `StreamHealth` |
| **Why this one** | One sentence decides it: **you cannot veto your way out of a lying sensor.** Everything downstream of L2 is compromised together, so a remedy has to read something that is not — and `StreamHealth` is computed at the sensor boundary before the filter touches anything. What the vehicle needs is not a refusal but a change of *posture*, and L8 already owns converting sustained evidence into a graduated one. **It also shrinks D-11's accepted risk**, because the integrity counter deliberately does *not* freeze during exploration: a narrowed envelope is a response to the world being unfamiliar and says nothing about whether the sensors are honest |
| **Gave up** | **Two thirds of OD-9, and the row stays open.** `StreamHealth` is computed from staleness, so `BIAS`, `DRIFT` and `STUCK_AT` — which keep the stream perfectly fresh — are invisible; the slow drift still ends 2.025 m out with the counter at 0. **No gate sees the fault even now**, so D-3's independence claim is no less contradicted. One unhealthy channel escalates, which over-fires on a platform with a different sensor set. And it creates a denial-of-service surface: an adversary who can silence one channel can stop the vehicle in two seconds — the right trade against a loss-of-lane-position hazard, but a trade |

### D-12b · Analytical redundancy, tried and refuted

**Kept because a log of only successful decisions is a brochure, and because the
refutation is worth more than the attempt would have been.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | OD-9's remaining two thirds. A self-consistent lie is invisible to every mechanism in the system; the general answer is a second sensor, and the reference plant cannot express one |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Wait for Phase 7 and real redundancy — still the fallback. (b) **Build a second estimate from the issued commands**, propagated through the process model: commands are not measurements, so the two should share no channel |
| **Why it was tried** | It costs microseconds, needs no hardware, and the failure mode is checkable in advance — which is exactly the profile the shadow convention exists to exploit |
| **Why it failed** | **FB1 feeds the issued command into the filter's prediction step**, so the two estimates share the process model *and* the command input and differ only by the measurement correction. The residual measures "how far the measurement pulled the filter", which under a slow drift is exactly the drift rate — and the propagation's own uncorrected error accumulates 2.2x to 4.0x faster than that. **Refuted by the feedback loop that exists to mitigate the very defect it was built to attack**, and FB1 is load-bearing and not removable |
| **Gave up** | Nothing shipped, so nothing was given up but the time. The cost of *not* shadowing it would have been a monitor whose false-alarm rate exceeded its detection rate, wired into a fail-safe machine |
| **What it bought** | A quantitative bound rather than an intuition — 0.022–0.040 m of residual per tick of window against a 0.010 m/tick fault — and it identified the surviving candidate: a **cross-channel** check that does not integrate and does not pass through FB1 |

### D-12c · A commissioning certificate reports three verdicts, not two

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | OD-11. NFR5 claims a second platform costs only an adapter, and measured against a warehouse AGV that is **partly false**. "Which contexts does this platform actually work in" is the question that finding leaves open, and nothing answered it — the four seeded profiles were an assumption nobody had checked a vehicle against |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Binary certified / not certified** — rejected, and this is the whole design decision: it reports `BOUNDED` as a *failure*, when bounded safe exploration is the behaviour the architecture exists to have. A vehicle that drives safely inside a narrowed envelope in an uncalibrated context has not failed; it has a weaker certificate. (b) A continuous fitness score — rejected: an integrator needs a decision, and a score defers it back to them. (c) Add a fourth `MARGINAL` verdict — rejected on the second platform's evidence; a majority-hold rule inside `BOUNDED` carries the same information without diluting a three-way answer. (d) **CERTIFIED / BOUNDED / UNFIT**, with the reason phrase on every row including the passes |
| **Why this one** | It mirrors what the architecture actually does. A certificate that could not express *"safe here, not calibrated here"* would be describing a different system |
| **Gave up** | Three verdicts need a hold threshold, and any threshold is arguable. It is set at a bare majority and deliberately not tuned finer — a value chosen to make a particular platform pass would be fitted to that platform |
| **What it found immediately** | On the calibrated platform, **three of the four seeded profiles are unreachable** — not because the road conditions differ but because `ego_speed` is *measured*, and this policy realises 0.28 against `HIGHWAY_CLEAR`'s centroid of 0.80. On a weak-braking platform, **all four**. E-82 had recorded this as a tuning trap; the certificate makes it a reported column |
| **What it got wrong first** | The verdict asked only whether a profile had *ever* matched, and reported a platform that spent **360 of 400 ticks in exploration** as CERTIFIED. Found by running a second platform rather than by review — the same instrument that found OD-12 and OD-13 |

### D-12d · The vehicle proposes calibration *work*, never a calibration — [ADR-0025](adr/0025-the-vehicle-proposes-calibration-work-never-a-calibration.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The commissioning certificate: **four of five contexts come back `BOUNDED`**, meaning the vehicle drove for hundreds of ticks accumulating evidence about a context nobody calibrated for, and discarded all of it. A fleet doing that for a year discards the most valuable dataset anyone could have about where their coverage is missing |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Propose a full profile, quantile table included** - rejected, and it is why this record exists: a table fitted to the vehicle's own exploration is **FB3 by another name**, pinning the veto rate to epsilon by construction (E-40), and every metric keeps looking healthy while the gate degenerates. (b) **Propose a profile inheriting the nearest one's quantile table** - rejected: it asserts, on no evidence, that an uncalibrated context has its neighbour's non-conformity distribution, the assumption OD-8 already found violated. (c) **Auto-approve after enough evidence** - rejected, and it must *stay* rejected: it is the obvious next request and it converts a human gate into a threshold. A system that certifies itself from its own data will certify anything. (d) **Run it inside L9** - rejected on three counts: a learning mechanism on the hot path against SI-8, a fleet of one, and runtime standing the shadow convention says it has not earned. (e) **Cluster across runs first** - deferred, not rejected; unmeasurable on one vehicle. (f) An **offline reader of the audit log** that emits a *calibration request* |
| **Why this one** | A request carries only what the vehicle can honestly claim to know: centroid, spread, safety record, nearest profile, and a pointer to the ticks. **No quantile table, no coverage level, no certification dates.** Being offline satisfies the shadow convention *structurally*: there is no wire to cut because none was laid. And it is how a fleet actually works, vehicles uploading evidence and a backend proposing |
| **Gave up** | **It proposes work, not capability.** Nothing improves until a human runs a calibration, so anyone measuring "contexts certified per week" finds it does nothing alone. That is the design. Three filter thresholds that are arguable and untuned, because there is no population to tune against. Coherence checked per component, not jointly, so a diagonal drift through signature space would pass. And a forged log is a forged request, the same residual the threat model already carries |
| **What it exposed** | **OD-14.** The arbitration record carried the outcome and the trust score but *not the signature RCM decided on*, so the log could say `SAFE_EXPLORATION` and not say what context that was. Found by trying to **use** the evidence rather than by reviewing it, a fifth distinct instrument, and it is the third instance of one shape after `fast_innovation` and `previous_digest`: a quantity the pipeline computes, consumes, and archives nowhere |

### D-12e · Redundancy, measured -- and the blocker was thirty lines of harness

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | Four refuted candidates and one shared root: a self-consistent lie slower than the sensor noise cannot be distinguished from truth by any function of a **single sensor chain**. The only remaining move is to put new information in |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Wait for Phase 7**, which is what three refutations said and what I repeated. (b) Bound the consequence instead of detecting the cause -- cap how far the estimate may move without corroboration; still open and cheaper than it looks. (c) **Check whether the blocker was real**, and it was not |
| **Why this one** | *"Unmeasurable here"* rested on two facts that both live in the **test harness**: one payload published to five modalities, and an extractor reading one of them. `FusedSensorFrame` already carries per-modality samples and `MeasurementExtractor` is an injectable port, so nothing in `src/` had to change. **A constraint cited three times turned out to be a property of thirty lines nobody had questioned** |
| **Gave up** | Nothing shipped into the pipeline, and that is deliberate: redundancy is measured **beside** the vehicle, not by it. Wiring it is a further decision. The measurement also inherits the plant's honesty limits -- the channels differ by noise draw and sigma, not by physics, so this shows the *information exists*, not that a real sensor suite would behave this way |
| **What it found** | The faulted channel separates at **5.3x** and is **identified** rather than merely detected, at +41 and +28 ticks against a departure at +73. And a caveat worth more than the headline: the good channels are perturbed too -- 2.4x on LIDAR under an IMU fault, because with three channels the median itself moves -- so the honest margin is **2.2x over the next channel**, not 5.3x over the control |
| **What it exposed** | **OD-15.** Five sensor modalities carrying one measurement, which is why every cross-check had nothing to check against. It sharpens D-3: the three gates were known to share L2's estimate, and this says the *modalities feeding L2* were never distinct either |

### D-12f · The integrity counter rises on a lost quorum — [ADR-0027](adr/0027-the-integrity-counter-rises-on-a-lost-quorum.md)

**The successor ADR-0024 named, written when its trigger arrived.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | ADR-0026's first run. One faulted channel of three HALTed a vehicle driving at **0.042 m** on the other two with a working median (E-116) — a recoverable fault converted into a stop. ADR-0024 had written the trigger down: *"any modality, not a quorum ... when redundancy exists this is the line that should become a vote, and it needs its own decision record when it does"* |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **A constant in the layer** — rejected, it is platform knowledge and NFR5 forbids it there. (b) **Have the monitor report DEGRADED while a quorum survives** — tempting because it needs no L8 change, and rejected twice over: L8 treats anything not HEALTHY as unhealthy so it moves the problem rather than fixing it, and downgrading a channel's *reported health* to obtain a downstream behaviour is the inversion this register has filed twice. (c) **A frame-level trustworthy boolean from the monitor** — cleanest in the abstract, rejected as premature: it hides the severity decision in an adapter where configuration review cannot see it. (d) **A second threshold, tolerated-but-degraded** — deferred with reasons. (e) **Count unhealthy modalities against a configured tolerance** |
| **Why this one** | L8 counts; the **deployment declares**. How many lying channels a vehicle can absorb is a property of its sensor set, which is exactly the platform knowledge NFR5 keeps out of the layers, and putting it in configuration puts the claim in a file a safety engineer signs. At zero — what every shipped profile sets — it is bit-identical to the old rule, so the change carries no regression risk it has not measured |
| **Gave up** | **Losing fault tolerance does not change the posture.** At tolerance 1 the first faulted channel leaves the vehicle one fault from a stop and the machine says NOMINAL. Defensible — the vehicle is fine — and a real reduction in margin that only the health map records. **And a wrong tolerance is a serious wrong number nothing can check**: set to 1 on a vehicle with one publisher per quantity, the system ignores its only sensor, which is worse than the defect this fixes. It also counts *modalities* rather than *quantities*, so uneven redundancy must be declared at its weakest |

### D-12g · The deployment declares which sensors are critical — [ADR-0028](adr/0028-the-deployment-declares-which-sensors-are-critical.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | A camera failure HALTing the vehicle in two seconds exactly as an IMU failure did, on a build whose extractor reads the IMU alone (E-126). **A nuisance stop caused by a component that was not contributing** |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Infer criticality from what the extractor reads** — rejected: it would make a safety response follow an implementation detail, and it would encode OD-15 as intended behaviour. (b) **A constant in L8** — platform knowledge in a layer, NFR5. (c) **Stop counting non-IMU modalities** — hardcodes this build. (d) **A declared critical set** |
| **Why this one** | **L8 counts; the deployment declares.** *Which sensor feeds what* is platform knowledge, and putting it in configuration puts the claim in a file a safety engineer signs. A modality outside the set is still **recorded** — not counted is not not seen |
| **Gave up** | No default (A-4), so a wrong declaration is a serious wrong number: name a sensor non-critical that the argument depends on, and the vehicle drives on a dead sensor. **The prototype declines its own escape hatch** — every shipped profile still lists all five, because narrowing would be true only *because of OD-15*, and encoding a known defect as a safety claim makes the configuration a record of what is broken rather than what is intended |

### D-12h · Capability withdrawal is a second axis, not a third counter — [ADR-0029](adr/0029-capability-withdrawal-is-a-second-axis-not-a-third-counter.md)

**The fourth change to this mechanism in five days, and the first that does not touch the counter.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | ADR-0028 leaving exactly **two** responses to a sensor failure, selected by one boolean: the whole ladder, or nothing (E-129). Every effect the machine has reads `state`, and `state` is one integer — so the response with the clearest per-sensor meaning, *lose the camera, stop offering lane changes, keep driving*, was **unrepresentable**. The diagnosis: one integer was being asked two questions, *how bad is this getting* and *what is broken* |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Per-modality severity ceiling** — one line, and wrong vocabulary: a ceiling says *how far*, never *what*, so it makes camera loss cap the **speed**; two sensors sharing a ceiling behave identically again, reproducing OD-18 one level down. (b) **Weighted counter** — rejected in ADR-0028 and still: nobody can defend *"the camera is worth 0.4 of an IMU"* to an assessor. (c) **One FSM per modality** — fully expressive, but the vehicle has one throttle, so five postures must be combined anyway; the combination rule *is* the design question and this skips it while paying 5× the state, and muddies SI-7. (d) **Leave it and document the limitation** — my first recommendation, and wrong; see below. (e) **A declared capability map, composed by intersection** |
| **Why this one** | It answers the actual question with the right shape — *what is broken* with *what can no longer be done*, which is the question the manufacturer, the driver and the safety case all ask. Composition by **intersection** makes withdrawal subtractive-only, so a set able to *grant* what the posture forbids is unrepresentable rather than merely untested (SI-3). It is **orthogonal to `critical_modalities`**, which is what finally makes *non-critical camera, required by lane_change* expressible. And the dependency map is the **same artefact** as the safety case's degradation table, derived from the running machine rather than maintained beside it |
| **Gave up** | **Restoration is symmetric and probably should not be** — a flapping modality flaps its capabilities, and the fix needs a measured flap rate this platform has not produced; inventing N would be the same unfalsifiable number that got weighted counters rejected. **Nothing enforces a withdrawal yet**: the set is derived, recorded and reported, and does not bind an actuator — though neither does `lane_change_permitted`, so nothing regressed. **No shipped profile exercises the graceful path**, for ADR-0028's reason. **An empty declaration is ambiguous** in a single row |
| **The uncomfortable part** | **I recommended deferring this behind OD-15 and was wrong.** The argument was that four of five modalities feed nothing, so a dependency map would be fiction. It conflated two things: the map states what the vehicle **may do** when a sensor is unhealthy, not what the estimator reads — and camera health is real today, computed by L1 from per-stream freshness whether or not anything consumes the payload, which is exactly how a dark camera drove the counter to HALT in E-126. OD-15 blocks the *estimation* benefit and never touched the *capability* benefit. The merge delayed a change that had no reason to wait, and the ADR records it as a rejected alternative with the reasoning that made it wrong |

### D-12i · The health level caps how far the posture may escalate — [ADR-0030](adr/0030-the-health-level-caps-how-far-the-posture-may-escalate.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | `StreamHealth` telling four values apart since Phase 1 and L8 reading one bit of them. Measured: a camera **arriving late** stopped the vehicle exactly as a camera that was **gone**, all three unhealthy levels reaching HALT with φ = 40 (E-134). The enum's own docstring said collapsing them *"loses that distinction"* |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Per-level counter increments** — the weighted counter again, and nobody can defend the ratio. (b) **A configured cut-off, which level starts counting** — moves the line rather than removing it; two of three levels still behave identically. (c) **Have the monitor report a milder health while a quorum survives** — rejected for the third time, and worth naming as a recurring temptation: changing reported *health* to obtain a downstream *behaviour* is the inversion this register has filed twice. (d) **A declared per-level ceiling** |
| **Why this one** | A ceiling answers *how far*, and `StreamHealth` **is** a severity — literally how far past the staleness budget a stream has fallen — so mapping one severity onto another invents no number. It defends exactly one claim, *a late reading is less bad than no reading*, which an engineer can accept or reject on sight. This is also why ADR-0029 was right to reject a ceiling for **modalities**: identity is not a severity |
| **Gave up** | **A wrong ceiling is a serious wrong number nothing can check** — cap `ABSENT` at DEGRADED and the vehicle drives on a sensor that is gone. **The cap hides how bad it got** in the state field, though the counter beside it disambiguates. `FAULTED` below `ABSENT` is **asserted, not measured** |
| **The subtle part** | The ceiling caps a counter that persists, so a per-frame read would let a **recovering** sensor lift the cap and halt the vehicle on the counter it had already built — punished for the sensor coming back. It is a high-water mark that resets with the counter, and the test is named after the bug |

### D-12j · Decay measures the duty cycle the counter cancels out — [ADR-0031](adr/0031-decay-measures-the-duty-cycle-the-counter-cancels-out.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The counter moving +1 unhealthy / −1 healthy, so **any duty cycle at or below 50% nets to zero**. Measured over a full minute at 20 Hz: a camera dark on **alternate frames** — 600 of 1,200 ticks — held **NOMINAL** with the counter peaking at **1**; dark 3 frames in 13, NOMINAL with a peak of 3 (E-135). A duty-cycle detector with a 50% threshold, documented as a health detector |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Make the counter asymmetric** — cheapest, and it destroys the bounded 91-tick recovery the module docstring advertises, while still being unable to attribute. (b) **A second slower counter per modality** — needs its own threshold and decay rate, two more numbers with no measurement behind them. (c) **Monotonic count of unhealthy ticks** — useless after an hour; a start-up glitch is indistinguishable from a failure now. (d) **Detect it in L1** — arguably the right long-term home, deferred because L1 keeps no per-modality history and the quantity is wanted in the snapshot the audit record already reads. (e) **Leave it to fleet telemetry** — the data was not in the archive at all. (f) **A per-modality exponential average** |
| **Why this one** | It converges to exactly the quantity the counter cancels, and — unlike every weighting this project has refused — **the number means something**: a *fraction of recent frames*, with units, checkable against the hardware. Nobody has to accept a judgement to accept the measurement. **The counter is not wrong** and is left alone: it answers *am I in trouble now* and the answer really was no |
| **Gave up** | **A lagging indicator by construction** — a 200-tick window needs seconds to move, so an abrupt failure is the counter's job and not this one. **`decay_window_ticks` carries a default where A-4 values do not**, defended as a filter constant rather than a threshold, and still a number in a safety file chosen for being 10 s at 20 Hz. **No shipped profile arms the service signal.** **It still cannot see a sensor that lies fluently** — staleness-based health reads `HEALTHY` for ever, which is OD-9's remaining two-thirds |
| **The decision inside the decision** | **It drives nothing** — no posture, no veto, no command. A decaying sensor is a *service* condition, and a vehicle that stopped for maintenance would be the nuisance stop OD-18 removed arriving through another door. It also is **not cleared by `reset`**, or halt → reset → halt → reset would launder a failing sensor clean and the fleet record would show perfect health forever |

### D-12k · The fifth candidate, and the retraction that had to be withdrawn the same day

**The worst mistake in this log, and the only one caught by suspecting a result that looked good.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | Being asked *"can't you try detecting this?"* about a fault four measured refutations had closed. The useful move was checking **what each refutation actually tested**: E-53 and E-105 both tested innovation **magnitude**, and **neither tested whether the sequence is white** — the classical detector for this fault, and a different question |
| **What happened** | The sweep reported **7.35x separation**. E-107 — *"no function of a single sensor chain can distinguish a self-consistent lie slower than the sensor noise"* — was retracted in the register, the evidence log and a commit message. **All of it was measured on a vehicle with 400 of 400 ticks vetoed and a final speed of zero**, because the harness defaulted to a policy path that does not exist and fell back to the placeholder proposer |
| **Why the number was meaningless** | E-107's mechanism **is** the proposer closing the loop on a corrupted estimate and driving the vehicle toward it. With every command vetoed and the vehicle stationary that feedback does not exist, so the innovation keeps the persistent bias a closed loop absorbs. Re-run against the one checkpoint that drives, the drift separates **1.03x at every slack** while the bias separates 12.8x–14.3x (E-143) |
| **What caught it** | Not a test. **Bit-identical numbers across two different proposers** — impossible if the proposer mattered, and the only reason to look was refusing to accept a convenient result. Two more commands showed 400/400 vetoed and zero speed |
| **The fix** | `StationaryVehicleError`. **A benchmark that measures a closed-loop property must refuse to run when the loop is open** — two comparisons, and it was the difference between a finding and a retraction. The corrected result is *stronger* evidence for E-107 than a plain null, because it shows the bias appearing exactly when the loop opens and vanishing when it closes |
| **The uncomfortable part** | Everything downstream was correct. The statistics were right, the sweep was right, the false-alarm surface was right, E-94's precedent was followed, and the conclusion was still wrong — because **nobody checked that the vehicle was driving**. A result assembled correctly from an invalid configuration passes every review that checks the assembly. This is the same shape as OD-2 and OD-7, with the novelty that the inversion was **mine and same-day** |

### D-12l · The sigma points are redrawn after the process noise is added — [ADR-0032](adr/0032-the-sigma-points-are-redrawn-after-the-process-noise-is-added.md)

**The first deliberate departure from FilterPy, and the module docstring reserved the right to make exactly one.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | `update` observing the sigma points `predict` had pushed through `fx`, whose spread is the covariance **before** `Q` is added — so `S = H(P − Q)Hᵀ + R`, short by exactly the process-noise term, and every Mahalanobis distance the filter ever reported was inflated. Inherited from FilterPy, reproduced deliberately, and **pinned by a unit test so that changing it had to be a decision**. It became one; the pin fired |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Add `H·Q·Hᵀ` analytically** — needs an `H`, and a UKF has none; constructing a Jacobian to patch a sigma-point filter reintroduces the linearisation the formulation exists to avoid. (b) **Propagate `Q` into the points before `fx`** — inflates the prior rather than the prediction, so `fx` is evaluated where the process model was never meant to look and the mean shifts. (c) **Correct the distance downstream** — the correction is state-dependent, 1.39x at p25 and 1.02x at the maximum, so no scalar exists and computing one per tick means computing `S` properly anyway. (d) **Leave it and rename the field** — what the register already did, and it leaves a quantity three gates read carrying a name that is false. (e) **Redraw from the `Q`-inflated covariance** |
| **Why this one** | It is what the textbook formulation does, it invents nothing, and it fixes the **gain** as well as the covariance — the cross-covariance becomes `P·Hᵀ` against the predicted covariance, which is what a Kalman gain is defined against. Correcting `S` alone would have left the two inconsistent |
| **Gave up** | **Control quality, measurably**: a correct filter trusts each measurement less, so final lane deviation went 0.0122 m → 0.1218 m and two test bounds were loosened — recorded with the old values, because loosening a safety-adjacent bound is the move that most needs to stay visible. **Every archived `fast_innovation` before this is on the old scale**, and neither the audit schema nor the config hash records which formulation produced a row, because this is a code change rather than a configuration one — so a reader pooling a pre- and post-change archive has **nothing in the record to warn them**. A second Cholesky per tick |
| **What it revealed** | The regeneration it forced turned up two things that **sharpen OD-9**. The faulted run now has *fewer* vetoes than the clean one — a frozen IMU stops the estimate moving, so commands get smoother and the jerk bound is never reached, and **the fault makes the system look healthier than health does**. It also ends *closer* to centre with a *smaller* estimator error, because a dropout makes the filter coast. Both proxies that used to distinguish the runs were coincidences and are deleted. **The integrity counter, 40 against 0, is now the only discriminator** — which is exactly what ADR-0024 was built for, and OD-9's case is stronger for the alternatives having fallen away |

### D-12m · Redundancy is the driven path, not a measurement beside it — [ADR-0033](adr/0033-redundancy-is-the-driven-path-not-a-measurement-beside-it.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | The register's own words on OD-15: *"the pipeline is still driven by one channel, so redundancy is measured beside the vehicle rather than by it. Wiring it is a further step and needs its own decision record."* ADR-0026 built the machinery and ADR-0027 fixed the escalation policy; the default remained **one sensor published five times** |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Keep the default and document it** — what the register did for four days, and the reason the row stayed open: a capability demonstrated in a benchmark is not a capability the system has. (b) **Make it a TOML setting** — wrong layer; which sensors a vehicle carries is a property of the plant, and `integrity_tolerated_faults` is already the configuration that *responds* to redundancy. (c) **Publish three channels but keep fusing one** — the monitor could then name a liar the estimator was still listening to, which is worse than either end. (d) **Five channels** — a camera and a radar do not measure lateral position the way an IMU, a GPS and a lidar do; it would have padded the quorum with duplicates again. (e) **Three channels, unequal noise, by default** |
| **Why this one** | Three because a median needs three to have a middle — with two, a disagreement says *something* is wrong without saying which, and with three the largest residual **names the liar**. Unequal because identical sigmas model identical sensors and identical sensors share a failure mode: a vehicle carrying three copies of one part has one part. And `single_channel=True` rather than `redundant=None`, because a default that silently meant *"one sensor"* is exactly how the defect survived — nothing at the call site was false, it simply never mentioned the thing that mattered |
| **Gave up** | **Every number in the pack moved**, second regeneration in a day. **The three channels share the plant** — their errors are independent but all three observe the same simulated truth through the same model, so **no channel count catches a plant-model error**, which is the boundary of the whole `[M-syn]` column. **This is the harness, not `src/`**: nothing in the library changed, which is architecturally good and means a *deployment* still has to supply real redundancy. And a real vehicle's channels are not three unbiased Gaussians around truth — GPS is absolute and drifts slowly, an IMU integrates, a lidar is relative to landmarks — so this is generous to the median |
| **What it bought** | The clean run six times better, and **a 1 m bias that never reaches the estimator at all** — the biased arm becomes indistinguishable from the healthy one to four decimals. It also repays ADR-0032 with margin: **the honest fix for a filter that must trust each measurement less is better measurements**, not retuning the ones it had |

### D-18 · A per-file coverage floor, far below the aggregate gate

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | **The quality gate passing a module with no tests.** `astra explain` shipped at **10.3%** coverage and `make check` was green, because 94 uncovered statements against several thousand move a 95% *aggregate* by less than a tenth of a point (OD-17, E-123) |
| **Alternatives** | (a) **Leave it and rely on review** — rejected; this repository has filed four separate defects that review did not catch, and the point of a gate is not needing to remember. (b) **Raise the aggregate** — does nothing: the arithmetic that hid a 10% module hides it just as well at 97%. (c) **Per-file floor at the aggregate value** — would fail three healthy files today and be switched off within a week, which is worse than not having one. (d) **Diff coverage on changed lines** — genuinely better for a team with review gates, and it needs CI plumbing this prototype does not have. (e) A **per-file floor set far below** the aggregate |
| **Why this one** | Its job is to catch a module with **no** tests, not to chase the last branches out of covered code. At 80% it passes every file in the tree today **and fails the defect that motivated it**, which is the whole specification — replayed, exit code 1, the file named. A guard that only ever fires on the case that created it is worth more than one nobody keeps |
| **Gave up** | It says nothing about *what* is tested, only how much — and this project has 2,900 tests and a register of seventeen defects that none of them caught, so coverage was never the claim. `__main__.py` is excluded, by name rather than by pattern, because a pattern quietly grows |
| **The uncomfortable part** | A-7 has cited the aggregate since Phase 1 and the aggregate was always **true**. What it never licensed was a statement about any particular module, and nobody noticed until a module was shipped that needed one. Same shape as OD-2 and OD-7 — a check asserting more than it verifies — with the novelty that **the check was the quality gate** |

---

## Part 3 · Decisions about how the project works

### D-13 · No mechanism gets authority until it has run with none

**The standing convention, and the one that has paid for itself most often.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | FB2 and FB3. Both were specified as live loops, both would have broken the gate they feed, and **neither would have shown up as an error** — FB2 collapses the non-conformity score while every metric continues to look healthy; FB3 pins the veto rate to ε *by construction*, because ε of any distribution lies above its own 1−ε quantile |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Wire and monitor — rejected: both failure modes are invisible to monitoring, which is the whole point. (b) Wire behind a feature flag — rejected, a flag defaulting to on is wired. (c) Run it as a pure function of the decision record, changing no verdict, and diff it against the live system |
| **Why this one** | A mechanism that cannot change a verdict **cannot flatter itself**. It has since caught three things: FB2, FB3, and — in the other direction — that P2.7's principled candidate was silent on the fault it was built for |
| **Gave up** | Every mechanism costs a measurement before it costs an implementation. That is the intended price |

### D-14 · Cite `EVIDENCE.md`, never restate it

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | Stale figures in three documents at once, and the 9 August date correction: every row was stamped `2 Aug`, and for most of them that was **provably impossible** — E-24 measures a fix committed on the 6th |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Restate figures where they are needed and sync them — this is what produced the staleness. (b) Generate the documents — over-engineering for a prototype. (c) One number, one place; every other document cites the `E-n` row |
| **Why this one** | A figure restated in two documents is a figure that will be stale in one of them |
| **Gave up** | Reading requires following a link. **And it does not fully work** — this session found `README.md` and `SEPARATION_INVARIANTS.md` both four weeks stale, in opposite directions |

### D-15 · Retract, do not refresh

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | `COMMERCIAL_ASSESSMENT.md` quoting "2,513 tests at 98% coverage" — correct on its date, wrong now |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Update the figures in place — rejected: a dated snapshot that is silently refreshed **stops being a snapshot**. (b) Delete the document. (c) Leave it, with its date as the caveat, and re-issue rather than edit |
| **Why this one** | The value of a dated assessment is that it says what was believed on that date |
| **Gave up** | Documents accumulate. The register carries the cost as a known-stale list rather than as invisible drift |

### D-16 · Strict xfail for a claim that is false

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | NFR5. Domain independence is claimed in `assembly.py`'s own docstring and is **partly false** — four walls, found by building a warehouse AGV and driving it at the pipeline |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Delete the claim — rejected, the claim is the goal. (b) File a ticket — rejected, tickets do not fail builds. (c) A test per wall, marked strict xfail |
| **Why this one** | **Making the claim true turns the suite red** and forces the documents to be rewritten on the same day. A strict xfail is a promise with a deadline enforced by a machine |
| **Gave up** | Five permanently-failing tests in the output, which needs explaining to anyone reading the gate for the first time |

### D-17 · Rewriting history to strip a 200 MB blob

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced by** | A `str.replace("", new)` accident made `docs/PENDING.md` **210 MB** in two commits. GitHub refuses any pushed object over 100 MB, so the branch was **unpushable from 6 August and nothing found out until the 10th** — four days and thirty commits later |
| **Alternatives** | (a) Squash the history — rejected: the commit messages carry the reasoning for OD-9, the ablation result and the ADR-0020 refutation, and in this project that history is a deliverable. (b) Start a fresh branch — same objection. (c) `filter-branch` the two commits to carry their parent's copy of the file |
| **Why this one** | The rewrite is confined to unpushed commits, it is a fast-forward for the remote afterwards, and a backup tag makes it one command to undo. Nothing else in any commit changed and the working tree is byte-identical |
| **Gave up** | Twenty-six hashes moved, four citations had to be remapped, and hashes quoted *inside* commit messages are permanently stale. **The real fix was the guard**: `make blobsize` fails on any tracked file over 5 MB — a limit set just under the one that bites gives no warning |

---

## Part 4 · Challenges that were not decisions — the mistakes, and what they cost

**These are here because a log of only good decisions is a brochure.** Each is a
thing that went wrong in the work itself, what it cost, and what stops it
recurring.

| | Challenge | Cost | What stops it now |
|:--:|---|---|---|
| **C-1** | **`str.replace("", new)` on a 63 KB file.** Python inserts the replacement between every character | 210 MB blob, an unpushable branch for four days, a history rewrite | `make blobsize`, which scans the filesystem rather than `git ls-files` — the first version passed vacuously |
| **C-2** | **The plant integrated 2.5× faster than the controller.** `step_seconds` was 0.02 while the tick period was 0.05, and the docstring said 0.05 | **Every policy trained before 5 August was invalidated**, and L7b was 2.5× more permissive than configured, so the proposer's steering fitted inside slack that did not exist | The value is documented against `1 / fast_rate_hz` with the full history in its own docstring |
| **C-3** | **A reward term ~500× too small.** `action_rate_weight` was 6.0 against a task reward capping at 2.0; a step at exactly L7b's jerk limit cost one part in ten thousand | A policy that **stopped the vehicle** and collected centring reward for the rest of every episode — and ran a whole 100,000-tick soak without the defect being visible, because nothing measured speed | The weight is derived from L7b's bound rather than chosen, and the derivation is in the docstring |
| **C-4** | **ADR-0020's measurement went wrong four times in a row**, all on tick pairing between the command, the plant's truth and the sensor reading | Read the effectiveness 12–18% low and looked entirely plausible while doing it | The tick timeline is written out explicitly in `benchmarks/effectiveness.py`'s module docstring |
| **C-5** | **Cold-path context tuned by intuition inverted the result.** A signature that *looks* like clear highway sat in permanent `SAFE_EXPLORATION`, because component 2 is ego-speed/legal-limit — 0.375 against a centroid of 0.8 | The tunnel demo would have shown exploration against a baseline that was already exploring | The tuning is measured and recorded as E-82, and the failure is kept in the row |
| **C-6** | **Overstating OD-10 as "22×"** — that is the per-channel algebraic bound, not the realised effect | A register row that overstated what was broken. Realised: 1.53× on the bottom half, **1.23× in the tail**, 1.024× on the largest single distance | The row was corrected with a dagger rather than edited, and E-71 carries the measurement. *A register that overstates what is broken loses trust as fast as one that understates it* |
| **C-7** | **`--delete-excluded` on an rsync wiped `~/astra/var`** — the trained twin, the calibration corpus and the policy | Restored from tracked Windows copies; would have cost a retrain otherwise | Named in the environment notes; the artefacts are tracked |
| **C-8** | **A snapshot's `speed_cap` of `None` rendered as `0.0`** would have shown *commanded stop* on every healthy tick | Caught by running the dashboard, not by a test — every fixture had set a cap | E-79, and `test_every_field_is_declared_as_record_or_simulator` fails if a field is added without declaring its source |
| **C-9** | **Two integration tests asserted a defect**, and fixing the defect broke them | Correct behaviour, and it must not be papered over: one of them said in its own comment *"pinned so that a future change which fixes it fails here and has to say so"* | It fired, and this log entry is part of the saying-so. The tests were rewritten to assert the new truth **and** to keep pinning the half that is still broken |
| **C-11** | **A forensic tool shipped with no tests, and the gate was green.** `astra explain` at 10.3% coverage | A module a safety case would lean on, unverified, in a pushed commit | A per-file coverage floor (D-18), and 29 tests taking it to 95.2%. **Found by asking the coverage question about the module rather than about the codebase** — the aggregate had nothing to say |
| **C-10** | **An integration rig published one sensor modality of five.** Harmless while nothing read stream health; a vehicle with four dead sensors once L8 did | Two tests failed on a change that was working correctly | The rig now publishes every modality, as the closed-loop harness and a real vehicle do, and the old behaviour is pinned by a test that asserts a one-modality vehicle **does not stay NOMINAL** |

---

## The pattern, stated once

Read the **Forced by** column top to bottom. Eleven of the seventeen decisions
were forced by a measurement that contradicted a document, and **not one of them
was caught by the test suite, `mypy --strict`, or the twelve import contracts** —
all of which were green throughout.

Four of them share one shape, and it is the shape worth naming:

> **The composition is correct at every layer and wrong as a whole.**

- **OD-4** — every layer handled `position_y` correctly; nothing observed it.
- **OD-6** — L6's veto and L9's envelope were each right; they answered the same
  question and disagreed.
- **OD-12** — L8's counting and L9's exploration were each right; they owned the
  same condition and the terminal answer won.
- **OD-9** — every gate reads the state estimate, which is correct; all three
  therefore fail together when it lies.

That is the argument for this architecture and it is also the argument against
trusting it: a system assembled from correct parts needs **runtime evidence**,
because static verification of the parts cannot see the composition. Every entry
in Part 2 is a case where the evidence found something the verification could
not.
