# ADR-0020 — FB2 estimates the control effectiveness, rather than regressing on commands

**Status:** Accepted; **amended 9 August 2026 after the shadow run — do not wire as originally specified**
**Date:** 9 August 2026
**Follows:** [ADR-0019](0019-one-twin-head-per-context.md), which fixed *where* FB2
writes. This fixes *what it learns from*.

## Context

ADR-0019 gave the twin one output head per context, which made catastrophic
forgetting structurally impossible. It did not touch the loss, and the loss is
where the remaining defect lives.

`_consolidate`'s data term is `MSE(predicted, applied)`, and `applied` is the
issued command — the proposer's on 99.9% of ticks. **FB2's only source of labels
is the component the twin exists to be independent of.**

`twin.py`'s module docstring already names the consequence:

> *If the twin were trained until it predicted Core-A's policy accurately, every
> non-conformity score would be small, the statistical gate would stop firing,
> and the system would look healthy while having disarmed one of its three
> gates.*

Measured rather than assumed (E-39). Over 100,000 ticks in a context where
nothing changed, with FB2 running against a twin nothing reads: the score against
the live twin stayed flat to four decimal places, 1.1564 → 1.1560, while the
score against the adapted twin fell **40%**, 1.1534 → 0.6962, monotonically and
still falling at the end.

Offline training does not have this problem. `train_twin.py` labels each state
with `steer = lateral / gain` — the inverse of `B·π = a_lat`, physics, with the
proposer playing no part. Only the *online* loop regresses on commands.

## Decision

**FB2 estimates the platform's control effectiveness `B` from measured response,
and stops fitting a network to commands.**

What "the vehicle's response has changed" *means* — tyre wear, load shift, a wet
road — is that the true `B` has moved. That is directly observable from the pairs
FB2 already receives: command a steering value `s`, observe the lateral
acceleration `a` it produced, and `a / s` is the effective `B`.

The estimate feeds the physics residual the whole twin is anchored on. The twin's
weights stop moving online altogether.

**It lives in the adapter, not in L5.** `B` is a platform fact — it is
`control_effectiveness` in configuration precisely because NFR5 keeps vehicle
knowledge out of the layers — so the thing that estimates it belongs on the same
side of that boundary. L5 consumes the estimate through the existing settings
seam rather than computing it.

### The requirement that makes it work, and it is not optional

**Saturated samples must be excluded.** Measured on the synthetic plant, whose
configured `B` is 140.0 and which clamps lateral acceleration at 3.0 m/s², so it
saturates beyond `|steer| = 0.0214`:

| samples used | recovered `B` | error |
|---|---|---|
| linear region only (`\|steer\| ≤ 0.02`) | **140.000**, σ = 0.0000 | **0.000 %** |
| wide steer, saturated excluded | **140.000**, σ = 0.0000 | **0.000 %** |
| wide steer, saturated **admitted** | 116.0, σ = 30.5 | **17.1 %** low |

Exact when the condition holds; 17 % low when it does not, and *biased in the
dangerous direction* — an underestimated `B` makes the twin expect more steering
than the vehicle needs, which shrinks the departure the score is computed from.

Saturation is detectable without extra instrumentation: `|a_lat|` sits at the
configured limit. A sample at the limit carries no information about `B` and must
be dropped rather than averaged in.

The first probe of this ADR got 17 % because it drove ±0.05 steer into a plant
that saturates at 0.0214, and read the bias as a property of the estimator rather
than of the probe. It is recorded because the same mistake in production would be
silent.

## Options considered

| Option | Benefit | Drawback | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Estimate `B` from measured response** | The target is measured physics, so drifting toward the proposer is **impossible rather than penalised** — the same move as ADR-0019, one level up. Recovers `B` exactly. Forgetting is moot: a scalar per context, not a network. Removes online weight updates from a safety reference entirely | Tracks a *gain* change, not a *shape* change. Needs saturated samples excluded. `B` is platform configuration, so placement needs care | **chosen** |
| B. Label FB2 from physics, keep the network | Looks like the minimal change | Does not work. The physically-consistent command satisfies `B·π = a_lat` with `B` **configured**, so labelling from a fixed `B` reproduces `train_twin.py`'s corpus exactly and FB2 learns nothing it did not ship with |
| C. Raise `physics_weight` on the online path so the residual dominates | Cheap | A tuning answer to a structural problem. This phase has already shown twice where those end up — `ewc_lambda` at a value that did nothing, and a penalty that could not be selective at any value | rejected |
| D. Do not wire FB2 at all | Correct today, and costs nothing | Gives up a quarter of the stated architecture permanently, on the grounds that one implementation of it was wrong | rejected |

**On A's drawback.** Losing shape adaptation is accepted deliberately.
Expressiveness is what let FB2 learn the policy in the first place; a reference
the proposer cannot move is worth more than a reference that fits well. If shape
adaptation is ever needed, it belongs offline, where the labels come from a
corpus rather than from the thing being judged.

## Consequences

Good:

- The twin's weights stop changing during a run. `twin_weights_digest` becomes
  constant by construction rather than by FB2 being switched off, which makes the
  soak criterion *"the twin is the one the run started with"* meaningful instead
  of vacuous.
- `B` is one number per context with a physical meaning and a configured
  starting value, so a wrong estimate is legible in a way a wrong network is not.
- The estimator can be checked against its own configuration: a live estimate far
  from the configured `B` is either a genuine platform change or a fault, and
  either is worth an event.

Costs and open questions, none of them resolved here:

- **Sample starvation.** With steer drawn from ±0.2, only 387 of 4,000 samples
  survived the saturation filter. A vehicle that corners hard spends much of its
  time saturated, and that is exactly when someone would want the estimate. The
  update rate must be measured, not assumed.
- **Noise on a real platform.** The synthetic plant is noise-free in this
  relation, which is why σ came out at exactly zero. On a real vehicle `a / s` is
  a ratio of two noisy quantities and will need a recursive filter rather than a
  median.
- **Where the boundary lands.** L5 currently reads `control_effectiveness` from
  settings once at construction. Making it read a live estimate is a port change,
  and the port must not let a layer reach into the adapter.

**Measured in shadow before it is wired**, like FB2 and FB3 before it. That is
now the standing rule for feedback loops in this project, and it has caught two
defects that no test would have.

## Compliance

- **NFR5**: strengthened. The estimator sits with the other platform knowledge
  rather than inside a layer.
- **SI-3, SI-7**: untouched. Nothing here changes which component may veto or
  issue.
- **A-4**: `control_effectiveness` remains a configured value with no default. The
  estimate refines it at runtime; it does not replace the requirement to state it.
- **RK-5** (catastrophic forgetting): retired for FB2. There is no longer an
  online network update to forget anything.

## Measured in shadow, 9 August 2026 — and the placement was wrong

The estimator was built and tested in isolation, where E-43 recovered the
configured `B = 140.0` to **0.000%** error. This decision said it should live in
the adapter and observe executed outcomes, and the standing convention says no
loop gets authority until it has run with none. So it was run with none, across
the control, six injected faults, and two plants whose true `B` differs from the
configured value by ±20%.

| scenario | true `B` | from the **estimate** | from the **raw reading** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| control | 140.0 | **140.000** | 137.843 |
| `imu_dropout` | 140.0 | 140.000 | 139.278 |
| `position_drift` | 140.0 | 140.000 | 137.463 |
| `lateral_noise` | 140.0 | 140.000 | 140.000 |
| **platform `B`=112** | **112.0** | **140.000** | **111.341** |
| **platform `B`=168** | **168.0** | **140.000** | **165.140** |

**Fed the filtered estimate, the estimator returns the configured value on every
platform it is ever shown.** Not approximately — exactly, to three decimals, on
a vehicle whose true effectiveness is 20% away in either direction. The reason is
structural rather than a tuning problem: the UKF's process model already assumes
`B`, so its estimate of lateral acceleration is that assumption propagated. An
estimator reading it measures the configuration and calls the result a
measurement.

Wired that way the loop would be perfectly stable, perfectly uninformative, and
would report *"the platform has not changed"* for any platform. That is the
failure mode this register has now recorded five times — a mechanism that fails
by making the evidence look fine — and it is precisely what the shadow rule
exists to catch.

**Fed the raw measured response it works**, tracking 112 to 111.3 and 168 to
165.1, within 1.7%. And the risk this shadow run was written to look for did not
materialise: **no injected fault moves it materially.** The widest deviation
under any fault is 0.4% from the control, and the 25×-sigma noise burst leaves it
at 140.000 exactly, because the estimate is a median.

### The amendment

**The input is the raw measured lateral acceleration, not the filtered estimate
and not the plant's truth.** The original text — *"observe the lateral
acceleration it produced"* — is ambiguous between the three, and the ambiguity is
the whole defect.

### What is still not done, and why

**The loop is still not wired**, and this run is not sufficient to wire it:

- The ~1.5% low bias on the raw reading is unexplained. Small, consistent, and
  in the direction ADR-0020 already names as the dangerous one — an
  underestimated `B` shrinks the departure the non-conformity score is computed
  from. It should be understood before it is trusted, not after.
- Six hand-chosen faults are not a population. The estimator survived these;
  that is not the same as being robust.
- `B` is constant within every run measured here. A platform whose effectiveness
  *changes mid-run* is the case the loop exists for and the one nothing has yet
  tested.

### A note on how this was measured, because it went wrong four times

Every source of lateral acceleration sits at a different point in the tick, and
mis-pairing them reads the effectiveness 12–18% low while looking entirely
plausible. That is trap 5 in the 9 August handover — where an earlier probe read
17% low and it turned out to be a property of the probe — and it recurred three
more times here: first reading the plant's truth (which no adapter has, and which
made every sensor fault invisible), then over-correcting to a one-tick lag the
plant does not have, then applying the correct offset to the wrong source. The
timeline is now written down in `benchmarks/effectiveness.py` so the next person
does not rediscover it.
