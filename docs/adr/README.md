# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records one significant architectural decision: the situation that forced a choice, the
choice made, the alternatives that were rejected and why, and the consequences — including the ones
that hurt. In this project an ADR is not a summary of what the code does; the code and its module
docstrings already say that. An ADR exists to answer the question a reader will ask in eighteen
months, when the reasoning has left the building: *why is it like this, and what did we give up?*
That is why every record here carries a **Negative / accepted trade-offs** section, and why an
empty one would mean the record is wrong rather than the decision perfect. The first fourteen cover
the decisions taken during Phase 1 (Foundation) and ADR-0015 opens Phase 2; they are **Accepted**
and, unless a later ADR supersedes one, they describe the system as built. Where an ADR's reasoning
is also recorded in the source, the module docstring is named — the reader who opens
`kernel/units.py` should not have to find this directory to understand why `NewType` is there.

## Format

Every record follows the same structure, and new ones must:

```markdown
# ADR-000N: Title

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-000M
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Phase:** N (Name)

## Context
## Decision
## Alternatives considered
## Consequences
### Positive
### Negative / accepted trade-offs
```

## Writing a new one

Number sequentially; the number is permanent. Use a short kebab-case slug in the filename
(`0015-something-specific.md`) and add a row to the index above.

Write one when a decision has a *rejected alternative worth recording* — when a future reader could
reasonably ask "why not X?" and the answer took thought. Do not write one for a decision with no
alternative; that is just how the thing works, and it belongs in a module docstring.

Never edit an accepted ADR to reflect a changed decision. Write a new record and mark the old one
**Superseded by ADR-000M**. The value of this directory is that it shows what was believed at the
time, including where that turned out to be wrong.
