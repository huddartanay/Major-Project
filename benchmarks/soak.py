"""Drive the closed loop for hours and ask whether anything moved.

Why this exists
----------------
The longest run in this project's history before this script was four hundred
ticks -- eight seconds of simulated time. Every number the repository reports
was measured inside that window, and a control loop that is stable for eight
seconds is not thereby stable for an hour. Oscillation, slow drift, an estimator
walking away from the truth, a rolling window that never rolls, a queue that
fills: none of those are visible in four hundred ticks, and all of them are
things this architecture could plausibly have.

So the question this script answers is deliberately narrow: **over a long
continuous drive, does anything move that should not?** It is not a performance
benchmark (``benchmarks/latency.py`` is), and it is not a gate-accuracy
measurement -- it cannot be, because the plant, the twin and the calibration
corpus all descend from the same kinematic equations. What it can find is a
system that slowly stops working, and that is worth knowing before anything is
built on top of it.

Run it with::

    uv run python -m benchmarks.soak --ticks 100000
    uv run python -m benchmarks.soak --ticks 2000 --window 200        # a smoke run
    uv run python -m benchmarks.soak --ticks 100000 --cold-path tunnel

Invoked as a module, not a path: it imports ``training``, which lives at the
repository root rather than in ``src``.

How the measurement avoids measuring itself
--------------------------------------------
Two deliberate choices, both of which the obvious implementation gets wrong.

*Memory.* The harness keeps **per-window aggregates only**, never a per-tick
array. A soak that accumulated a hundred thousand samples would grow its own
resident set by tens of megabytes and then report that growth as the pipeline's.
Window state is bounded by ``--window``, so what the resident-set series shows is
the pipeline.

*Latency.* Only ``pipeline.tick`` is timed. The sensor publish, the plant step
and this file's own bookkeeping sit outside the measured region, so the
percentiles describe ASTRA rather than the harness driving it.

What the pass/fail criteria are, and what they are not
-------------------------------------------------------
Seven criteria gate the exit status: availability, finiteness, evidence
completeness, twin identity, lane-deviation drift, veto-rate drift, resident
growth and latency growth. Each has a threshold with a stated reason, and each
is checked against a *trend* across windows rather than a single number.

**Oscillation is reported, not gated.** A sustained oscillation shows up as a
wide peak-to-peak with a flat trend, and the direction-change count and range
are printed for every series so a reader can see one. No threshold is asserted
because none has been justified by a measurement yet, and a gate whose number
was picked to make the current run pass would be decoration.

        first_tick: First tick in the window.
        ticks: How many ticks the window covers.
        issued: Ticks on which a command reached the actuation sink. Anything

        mean_speed_mps: Mean true speed.
        mean_estimator_error_m: Mean ``|position_y estimate - truth|``. The

        origins: Counts by :class:`~astra.contracts.actuation.CommandOrigin` of

            "the fallback governed" from "bounded safe exploration governed",
            and therefore the series the cold-path experiment turns on.
        arbitrations: Counts by arbitration outcome, or empty when the cold
            path is dormant and no evaluation ran.
        proposals_issued_under_veto: Ticks on which Core-B's aggregate verdict
            was blocking and the proposal was nonetheless issued, because
            bounded safe exploration was engaged and

            no shadow was running. Also never gated, and for a stronger reason:
            FB2 is switched off, so this is a counterfactual and a criterion
            built on it would be gating the run on something that did not happen.
        max_shadow_divergence: The largest such gap in the window.
        shadow_digest: The shadow twin's weights digest, so a flat divergence can
            be told apart from a shadow that never moved.
        mean_live_score: Mean non-conformity score against the twin the gates
            read, or ``None``.
        mean_quantile: Mean static conformal quantile, or ``None``.
        mean_shadow_quantile: Mean quantile FB3 would have moved it to. The pair
            is FB3's counterfactual, as `mean_live_score`/`mean_shadow_score` is
            FB2's.
        shadow_veto_rate: The per-tick veto rate FB3's quantile would have
            produced. Never gated -- it describes a loop that is switched off.
        shadow_failsafe_states: Tick counts per state for a fail-safe machine
            driven by those counterfactual vetoes. **This is the D-1 number.** A
            veto runs the fallback for one tick; nothing degrades until the OOD
            counter crosses theta-1. Ticks outside NOMINAL are interventions; the
            per-tick veto rate is not.
        mean_shadow_score: Mean score against the shadow twin, or ``None``. The
            twin's own docstring says training it on the proposer's output would
            "make every score small and quietly disarm the statistical gate";
            FB2's only labels are the proposer's commands, so this column is
