"""Is the innovation *sequence* white? The fifth candidate against the slow drift.

What has already been refuted, and why this is not a repeat
------------------------------------------------------------
Four detectors have been measured against ``position_drift`` and four are
silent. It matters exactly what each one tested:

``E-53``
    The innovation sequence. *"Ramping 2 m over 200 ticks is 1 cm per tick
    against a declared sigma of 0.1 m, so every step is well inside what the
    filter expects and the innovation never leaves its band."* A **magnitude**
    test, per tick.

``E-105``
    The innovation gate at ``gamma = 7.5``. Also a **magnitude** test, and it
    flagged tick 0 of every arm including the control.

``E-94``
    Analytical redundancy from the issued commands. Refuted structurally: FB1
    feeds the command into the filter's prediction step, so the two estimates
    were never independent (E-95).

``E-106``
    Cross-channel consistency. Caught the bias at 4.14x and sat at **0.99x** on
    the drift.

Both innovation candidates asked *"is this innovation too large?"*. **Neither
asked whether the sequence is white**, and that is a different question with a
different answer. A correctly tuned filter produces innovations that are
zero-mean and serially uncorrelated; that is the standard optimality property.
A slow drift injects a **small persistent one-sided bias** into them. Every
sample stays inside the band -- E-53 is right about that and this benchmark does
not dispute it -- while the *signs* stop being a fair coin.

That is what a CUSUM accumulates. N samples with a mean offset of ``d`` standard
deviations sum to ``sqrt(N) * d`` standard deviations of separation, so a bias
far too small to trip any per-tick threshold becomes detectable given enough
ticks. Whether ``d`` is large enough here, on a filter whose estimate is being
dragged toward the lie, is precisely the empirical question -- and it is the
question E-107 answered with an argument rather than a measurement.

The claim under test, and the answer
--------------------------------------
E-107 states it: *"a self-consistent lie slower than the sensor noise cannot be
distinguished from truth by any function of a single sensor chain."* This
benchmark set out to falsify it.

**It does not. E-107 stands, and this is its fifth confirmation** -- ratio
**1.03x at every slack from 0.50 down to 0.02**, against a bias that separates
12.8x to 14.3x in the same sweep (E-143).

The route to that answer is the part worth reading, because for several hours it
said the opposite. Run against a policy path that did not exist, the harness
fell back to the placeholder proposer and measured a vehicle with **400 of 400
ticks vetoed and a final speed of zero**. On that vehicle the sweep reported
**7.35x** and E-107 was retracted on the strength of it.

The arithmetic was right and the configuration was meaningless. E-107's
mechanism *is the proposer closing the loop on a corrupted estimate and driving
the vehicle toward it*; with every command vetoed and the vehicle stationary,
that feedback does not exist, so the innovation keeps the persistent bias a
closed loop would absorb. **The false result was the mechanism's absence showing
up as a signal** -- which makes the corrected measurement stronger evidence for
E-107 than a plain null would have been, because it also demonstrates *why*.

:class:`StationaryVehicleError` now refuses the configuration that produced it.

The quantity this reads is computed and archived nowhere
----------------------------------------------------------
``InnovationRecord`` carries ``residual`` -- the **signed** measurement residual,
one element per observed dimension -- and ``mahalanobis_distance``, its norm.
**Only the norm is consumed.** The gates read it, the Trust Index reads it, the
audit record carries it from schema 3, and nothing anywhere reads the signed
vector. A norm is non-negative by construction, so the archive has thrown away
exactly the sign information a whiteness test needs, on every run ever recorded.

That is the sixth instance of the shape behind audit schemas 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10.
This benchmark therefore reaches into the estimator directly, which is what a
shadow measurement is for: nothing is wired, and if the detector earns its place
the archive has to change first.

    **This guard exists because its absence produced a wrong published result.**
    On 15 August this benchmark was run with a policy path that did not exist,
    fell back to the placeholder proposer, and measured a vehicle with every one
    of 400 ticks vetoed and a final speed of zero. It reported that the
    innovation sequence separates a slow drift 7.35x, and E-107 was retracted on
    the strength of it.

    The number was arithmetically correct and meaningless. E-107's mechanism is
    the *proposer closing the loop on a corrupted estimate and driving the
    vehicle toward it*; on a stationary all-vetoed vehicle that feedback does
    not exist, so the innovation keeps the persistent bias the loop would
    otherwise absorb. Re-run against a policy that drives, the same sweep
    reports **1.03x at every slack** (E-143).

    A benchmark measuring a closed-loop property must refuse to run when the
    loop is open. Detecting it costs two comparisons and it was the difference
    between a finding and a retraction.

    **Narrowed 16 August 2026, because the first version of this guard was
    itself wrong.** It tested ``final_speed_mps``, which asks *"is the vehicle
    moving at the end?"* rather than *"was the loop ever closed?"* Those were the
    same question in August. They stopped being the same question when ADR-0024
    and ADR-0030 gave the fail-safe a response that brings the vehicle to rest
    under a dark sensor: from then on the ``imu_dropout`` arm ended at exactly
    0.0000 m/s **because the safety mechanism worked**, and this guard refused
    it. `benchmarks.whiteness` produced nothing at all for a day, and nobody
    noticed, because nobody re-ran it.

    The guard now counts the ticks on which the loop actually *was* closed --
    the vehicle moving and a command reaching the actuators -- and raises only
    when that count is zero. An arm with some live ticks but fewer than
    :data:`_MINIMUM_LIVE_TICKS` is reported as thin instead of being quoted or
    refused.

    **The transferable part:** a guard is a claim about what a valid
    configuration looks like, and claims go stale exactly like numbers do. This
    project pins its audit schema with a test and asserts each invariant's
    enforcement kind with a test; the guards written after its three retractions
    were asserted by nothing that would notice them becoming wrong.

    """Sweep the CUSUM slack and report separation against the clean run.

    **A detector that only works at a slack chosen after seeing the fault is not
    a detector**, so this follows E-94's precedent and sweeps the free parameter
    rather than quoting one value. Two things have to be true at the same slack:
    the faulted peak must clear the clean peak by a wide margin, *and* the clean
    peak must be measured with the **startup transient included**. The plant
    starts up to 1 m off centre and corrects, which is a sustained one-sided
    manoeuvre -- the same shape a fault response has (E-96) -- so a threshold
    set from a cruise-only window would fire on every launch.

    Args:
        ticks: Total control ticks per arm.
        open_at: The tick each fault opens on.
        seed: Shared plant seed.
        policy: The trained proposer, or ``None`` for the placeholder.
