"""If this sensor fails, what does the vehicle stop being able to do?

The question, and who asks it
------------------------------
A safety engineer signing off a deployment needs one table: **per sensor, what
its loss withdraws and where the posture lands.** That table is the degradation
concept, it is required by every functional-safety argument worth the name, and
in most projects it is a document maintained by hand beside a state machine
maintained separately -- which is to say, a document that is wrong.

Here it is *derived*. Both halves come from the profile the vehicle actually
loads: ``failsafe.capabilities`` says what each function requires, and
``failsafe.critical_modalities`` says which sensors may move the posture. This
tool drives the real :class:`~astra.layers.l8_failsafe.machine.FailSafeStateMachine`
with one modality dark at a time and prints what happened. Nothing here restates
the configuration; it reports the machine's response to it.

That is the difference worth selling: the degradation table and the running
system cannot disagree, because the table is a measurement of the system.

The two axes, and why a row has two answers
---------------------------------------------
ADR-0029 gave the machine a second axis. A row therefore answers two independent
questions, and the interesting rows are the ones where the answers differ:

``posture``
    How bad it got -- NOMINAL, DEGRADED, LIMP, HALT. Driven by
    ``critical_modalities`` and the integrity counter.

``withdrawn``
    What broke -- the functions that named this modality. Driven by
    ``capabilities``, and *not* filtered by the critical set.

A row reading ``NOMINAL`` with functions withdrawn is the behaviour the design
existed to produce: the vehicle keeps driving and declines what it can no longer
do. A row reading ``HALT`` with nothing withdrawn means a sensor the deployment
calls critical carries no declared function -- which is worth a second look,
though it is not necessarily wrong.

The flag this tool exists to raise
------------------------------------
``INERT``. A modality that is neither critical nor required by any capability
has **no effect whatsoever** when it fails: the posture does not move and no
function is withdrawn. That is either a sensor nobody needs or, far more likely,
a sensor somebody added and forgot to wire a failure response for. It is a real
and ordinary integration bug, it is invisible in the code, and it falls straight
out of this table.

The check cannot live in a config validator, because nothing in the
configuration declares which sensors are *installed* -- a deployment genuinely
without a radar should not be nagged about one. Here the installed set is an
input, so the question is answerable.
