"""Single channel against three, clean and lied to, in one table.

Why this exists
-----------------
E-152 and E-153 are the strongest measurements this project has: driven by three
position channels instead of one, the clean run improves six-fold, and a 1 m
bias injected into one channel **never reaches the estimator at all**.

Both rows cited a command that does not produce them. ``benchmarks/redundancy``
prints the *shadow* residual monitor -- a different measurement, of a mechanism
with no authority -- and the figures actually came from calling
``drive_closed_loop`` with ``single_channel`` toggled, which lived in nobody's
script. A verification pass on 16 August 2026 found this by running the cited
command and not recognising the output.

**A number whose command cannot be re-run is not evidence.** This is that
command.

What the four arms are for
----------------------------
The table is a 2x2 and every cell earns its place::

                     clean            1 m bias on one channel
    single channel   the baseline     what the fault costs when nothing outvotes it
    redundant        the improvement  what the fault costs when something does

Read it **across the bottom row**. If the two redundant cells agree, the biased
vehicle and the healthy one are indistinguishable, which is what outvoting a
liar looks like when it works. Read it **down the left column** and you get the
cost of the fault without redundancy, which is the thing being fixed.

Peak estimator error, and why it is not the deviation
-------------------------------------------------------
Two quantities, and conflating them hides the mechanism:

``final |dev|``
    Where the vehicle ended up. A *control* outcome -- it includes the
    controller successfully compensating for a corrupted estimate.

``peak est err``
    The largest gap between the filter's ``position_y`` and the plant's truth.
    An *estimator* outcome. This is the one that says whether the lie arrived.

A fault can leave the deviation small while the estimate is badly wrong, which
is precisely OD-9's shape: the proposer closes the loop on the corrupted number
and drives *it* to zero. So the estimator column is the honest one, and it is
read from ``record.fast_state.mean[1]`` against ``TickSample.lane_deviation_m``.

Two earlier probes silently returned ``nan`` here, having guessed at field names
that do not exist on ``TickSample``. If this tool ever prints ``nan``, the
layout moved and the answer is to look, not to report around it.
