"""How long does one *assembled* tick take, and how stable is the tail?

Why this exists beside ``benchmarks/latency.py``
--------------------------------------------------
``latency.py`` times four layers in isolation -- L1 fusion, the L2 fast update,
the L7a shield, the L8 machine -- and reports a combined hot path of well under
a millisecond. That figure is real and it is not the one A-2 is about. A-2
claims **10 ms per tick at 20 Hz**, and a tick is the whole pipeline: the twin's
forward pass, three gates, arbitration, and an audit record written.

For nine months nothing measured that. On 16 August 2026 a verification pass
found the A-Z knowledge base asserting *"no end-to-end latency measurement
appears in the evidence pack"* -- which was wrong, because the soak records a
full-pipeline p99 (E-8), and also nearly right, because nothing measured it
directly and on demand. This closes that gap with a command.

Why it runs the measurement more than once
--------------------------------------------
Because the first time it was run once, and the single run said *"one tick in
2,000 over budget"*. Five runs said **0 to 31 ticks over budget**, with p99
ranging 2.768 ms to 10.460 ms and one run's p99 exceeding the budget outright.
The median was stable across every run to within 5%; the tail was not stable at
all.

**A tail statistic from one run is not a tail statistic.** That is the same
lesson as E-161's single sample and E-143's single configuration, arriving
through a third door, and it is why ``--runs`` defaults to five rather than one.

What this does NOT measure
----------------------------
The host is idle. ``benchmarks/flake_hunt.py`` puts the same machine under
``stress-ng`` and the test suite runs about 2.6x slower; nothing here says what
the tick tail does under contention. It also excludes any simulator round trip,
which is exactly what CARLA will add to every tick.

CPython offers no timing guarantee, so a figure from this tool is a
characterisation and never a bound.
