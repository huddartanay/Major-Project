## What ASTRA is

An AI controller in a safety-critical system can be structurally healthy — no bit flips, no
crashes, correct by every classical definition — and still issue a semantically wrong command
to a physical actuator, because the world it faces at runtime no longer matches the world it
was trained in.

Existing infrastructure does not catch this. Lockstep processors replicate the same wrong
answer on both cores. Hypervisors isolate execution domains without inspecting what crosses
them. Hardware security modules authenticate a command's origin, not whether it was a good
idea.

ASTRA governs the **actuation boundary**. It treats the AI controller as an *untrusted
proposer* and interposes an independent nine-layer pipeline between it and the actuators. Every
proposed command is evaluated three ways — statistically, physically, and against hard
deterministic bounds — by gates with structurally different failure modes, and the whole system
recalibrates itself from what actually happened.

> **Measured, August 2026.** This was not true until
> [ADR-0016](docs/adr/0016-exploration-may-not-override-a-deterministic-veto.md). A 100,000-tick
> run found the proposer's command issued on **99.8% of ticks despite a blocking verdict**, because
> bounded safe exploration was tested ahead of the verdict and, at the shipped operating point,
> exploration is engaged almost always. A gate with no calibration for its context now abstains
> instead of vetoing, no path overrides a veto, and the figure is zero. Six other findings from
> that run remain open — see [`docs/SOAK_REPORT.md`](docs/SOAK_REPORT.md) and
> [`docs/PENDING.md`](docs/PENDING.md).

Three gates, three unrelated ways to fail: the statistical gate fires on a statistical anomaly,
the physical gate on a violation of Newtonian admissibility, the deterministic gate on a hard
bound. The Hard Safety Shield's veto is unconditional and cannot be overridden by any other
component's PASS.

## Project status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Current phase** | **All ten layers built and composed. A trained policy drives the pipeline. FB1 and FB4 closed; FB2 and FB3 measured in shadow and refused.** |
| Implemented | All of **L1-L9** - the tick loop composing them - trained PINN digital twin - calibration corpus - **trained PPO policy under Lagrangian constraints** - **FB1 (UKF re-anchor)** - replay spine - one-way Core-A to Core-B channel |
| Also built | Fault injector with recorded ground truth ([ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-faults-are-injected-at-the-sensor-boundary.md)) - ablation study that neutralises a gate without making it optional ([ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-ablation-neutralises-a-gate-it-never-removes-one.md)) - ASTRA-vs-ungated-Core-A comparison harness - platform-transfer study - a **commissioning certificate** that measures which operating contexts a given vehicle is actually fit for - live SSE dashboard with interactive fault injection - first-party UKF (FilterPy removed) - hash-chained audit log and [threat model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) |
| Not yet implemented | **FB2, FB3** (both measured in shadow and found to break the gate they feed) - the CARLA adapter - MPC candidate scoring, which the paper's Figure 1 shows and which has never existed (A-9) |
| Quality gate | Green - **2 958 tests + 5 strict xfail**, `ruff` + `mypy --strict` over 161 files + **12** `lint-imports` contracts clean. The 5 xfails pin the four NFR5 walls of OD-11: making the claim true turns the suite red |
| Invariants | 10 declared, **all 10 mechanically enforced**. SI-3 now also covers issuance and abstention ([ADR-0016](docs/adr/0016-exploration-may-not-override-a-deterministic-veto.md)). |
| Measured | **100 000 ticks, all ten soak criteria pass.** 100 000/100 000 commands issued - proposer accepted on **99 997** ticks - mean lane deviation **0.0332 m** - resident set **+0.2 MiB** - full-tick p99 **9.3 ms** against a 50 ms tick - **0** audit records dropped. Every figure traces to a row in [`docs/EVIDENCE.md`](docs/EVIDENCE.md). |
| Decision log | [`docs/DECISION_LOG.md`](docs/DECISION_LOG.md) — every decision that could have gone another way, the options weighed, and what each choice gave up. Includes the mistakes |
| Open defects | **21 in the register - 16 closed, 1 reclassified, 1 partly closed, 3 open** - every one self-found, none by the test suite. See [`docs/CREDIBILITY_MATRIX.md`](docs/CREDIBILITY_MATRIX.md) |
| Next | Linux + CARLA for non-synthetic validation, which is also where OD-9's remaining two thirds are answered - see [`docs/PENDING.md`](docs/PENDING.md) |

> ### The limitation that governs every number above
>
> The digital twin, the calibration corpus and the trained policy **all descend from the
> same kinematic bicycle model**. The generator and the judge agree by construction. So
> these runs demonstrate that the architecture works, that a learned policy drives it, and
> that the gates evaluate genuinely learned commands - and they support **no false-positive
> or false-negative rate**, because nothing here is out-of-distribution in the sense the
> statistical gate is calibrated for. Closing that gap needs CARLA on a Linux host, and it
> is the highest-priority item on the roadmap.

> **R-6 resolved.** CARLA 0.9.16 publishes an official CPython 3.12 wheel, so the interpreter
> incompatibility that was this project's highest-rated technical risk no longer exists. CARLA has
> no macOS build, however, so simulator work needs a Linux x86-64 host — see
> [`docs/adr/0015-carla-interpreter-strategy.md`](docs/adr/0015-carla-interpreter-strategy.md).

Phase 1 deliberately contained **no layer logic** — only the vocabulary, contracts, interfaces,
invariants, configuration and evidence machinery every layer depends on. Phase 2 added the first
two layers and the replay spine on top of it. The reasoning is in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). No simulator and no GPU are needed:
everything through Phase 2 is developed and tested against in-process fakes.

```bash
git clone <repository-url> astra && cd astra
uv sync --all-groups --all-extras   # create .venv and install everything
uv run astra doctor           # verify the installation and print the environment report
uv run astra config show      # render the effective, fully-resolved configuration
uv run astra invariants list  # print the separation invariants and their enforcement
```

Run the full quality gate exactly as CI does:

```bash
make check     # format check + lint + type check + architecture contracts + tests
```

Or individually:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy
uv run lint-imports              # architecture fitness contracts
uv run pytest --cov=astra
```

See [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) for a full environment setup and
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the day-to-day workflow.

## Honesty boundaries

Carried forward verbatim from the Prototype & Demo Plan, because they constrain what this
codebase may claim:

1. The **1.25 µs Core-B intercept latency is an analytical hardware bound**, not a measurement.
   The software prototype's real latency will be in the low milliseconds, and must be reported
   against the software target of < 5 ms, never against the hardware figure.
2. False positive/negative targets are **< 1%, not zero**. The argument is defence in depth
   through structurally independent gates, never "eliminates hallucination".
3. The **shared UKF state is an acknowledged residual common-cause channel** across all three
   gates — mitigated by the innovation monitor and FB1, not eliminated.
4. Conformal prediction's coverage guarantee **assumes exchangeability**, which adversarial
   perturbation violates by construction. That is why there is more than one gate.
5. The PINN twin will be trained on **simulated dynamics**, not real vehicle physics.
6. Core-B here is **Python processes, not fabricated hardware**. FPGA/ASIC is roadmap, not done.

Any metric this repository reports must come from code that ran. Nothing is hardcoded to look
good in a demo.
