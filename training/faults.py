"""Injecting sensor faults into a closed-loop run, with ground truth attached.

Why this exists
----------------
Everything this project has measured so far shows that the machinery **runs**.
Section D of ``docs/CREDIBILITY_MATRIX.md`` -- what each gate actually
*catches*, which is the product claim -- has one row, and D-0 says why: nothing
in the synthetic plant is out-of-distribution in the sense L6 is calibrated for,
so no false-negative rate can be computed from it. Not with more ticks. Not with
a longer soak.

The missing ingredient is a fault with **known ground truth**: something wrong
with the world, whose shape, size and exact tick range are recorded
independently of whatever the gates then say about it. Given that, three
measurements become possible that are not possible today -- miss rate, detection
latency, and the false-alarm rate on the clean ticks either side. Given that,
``PENDING.md`` P3.5's comparison harness has its missing half: two instances,
same seed, same injected fault, one of which keeps moving.

Five separate open items reduce to this one. P3.4, P3.5, P4.2, section D of the
matrix, and P2.1's own stated limitation -- that the fail-safe speed cap has
only ever been observed under a *deliberate provocation*, never under a fault.

Where it attaches, and why not somewhere else
----------------------------------------------
At the **sensor boundary**: :func:`training.closed_loop._publish_state`, before
a reading reaches the bus. Nothing in ``src/astra/`` changes and nothing in
``src/astra/`` needs to know this module exists, which is the point --
fault-injection machinery inside a safety-critical package is a question with no
good answer, and the twelve import contracts plus ``make verify-install`` are
already the enforcement. See ADR-0022.

It also happens to be the honest place. From the pipeline's side a corrupted
reading is indistinguishable from a genuinely faulty sensor, because it *is* the
same event: L1 sees a payload, and nothing downstream can tell how it was
produced.

The five faults, and why each one
----------------------------------
Chosen so that each defeats a different defence, rather than for variety.

``BIAS``
    A constant offset. Miscalibrated IMU, a wheel-encoder scale error. The
    reading is fresh, well-formed and confidently wrong, so L1's staleness rule
    cannot see it and only the UKF's innovation sequence can.
``DRIFT``
    An offset ramping linearly to its final magnitude. The hardest case and the
    most realistic degradation: no single tick looks anomalous, so anything
    thresholding on a per-tick delta misses it by construction. This is the
    fault that separates a monitor from an alarm.
``STUCK_AT``
    The channel freezes at its last healthy value. Distinct from ``DROPOUT``
    because the reading remains **fresh** -- the classic failure a staleness
    check is powerless against, and the reason ``StreamHealth`` separates
    ``DEGRADED`` from ``FAULTED`` in the first place.
``NOISE_BURST``
    The declared sigma is multiplied while the sigma reported *to the filter*
    is not. The UKF over-trusts a stream that has stopped deserving it; the
    normalised innovations inflate, and the Trust Index is the layer that ought
    to notice.
``DROPOUT``
    The IMU publishes nothing. The one fault the existing machinery is designed
    for, included as the control: if a run under dropout shows nothing, the
    harness is broken rather than the system.

The rule this module exists to obey
------------------------------------
**A fault injector nobody has verified actually injects is worth nothing.** It
would produce a table of "faults the gates did not catch" that was really a
table of faults never injected, and -- exactly like the fail-safe speed cap
(OD-2) and the inert consolidation penalty (E-28) -- it would fail by making the
evidence look *better*, which is the failure mode this project has now been
bitten by three times and which testing cannot see by construction.

Two things follow, and both are load-bearing rather than decorative:

1. :class:`FaultSpec` **refuses to be configured inert.** A zero-magnitude bias,
   a window that ends before it starts, a magnitude on a fault that has no use
   for one -- each raises at construction. An injector that does nothing is not
   a quiet injector, it is a rejected one.
2. :class:`FaultEpisode` reports the peak error **measured while injecting**,
   not the magnitude that was requested. The two are equal when this module
   works and differ when it does not, so
   ``tests/unit/test_fault_injection.py`` can assert on the difference rather
   than on the intent.
