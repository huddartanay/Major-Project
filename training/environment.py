"""The synthetic CMDP the proposer is trained on, and the Lagrangian wrapper around it.

Offline. Nothing in :mod:`astra` imports this module, and nothing here runs on a
tick. It lives outside ``src/`` for that reason: Stable-Baselines3 and Gymnasium
are training dependencies, and putting them on the runtime import graph would
make the vehicle's control path depend on an RL framework it does not need.

The task
---------
Lane-follow a straight reference at a target speed. Not an interesting driving
task, and it is not meant to be -- the interesting object is the *constrained*
optimisation around it. What a good policy here has to do is trade progress
against the three constraint costs while a dual variable moves the price of each
one underneath it.

Dynamics are the kinematic bicycle model of
:func:`astra.layers.l2_estimation.models.fast_transition`, driven by the same
control-effectiveness row the twin uses. Reusing the pipeline's own transition
rather than writing a second one means a policy trained here is trained against
the motion the UKF assumes, which is the only reason its commands are meaningful
to the gates at all. It also means the limitation is inherited whole: the
generating model and the modelled model agree by construction, so nothing
observed here is out-of-distribution in the sense the statistical gate is
calibrated for.

SI-6, mechanically
-------------------
:meth:`SyntheticDrivingEnv.step` builds a
:class:`~astra.layers.l4_proposer.signal.TrainingSignal` and computes reward and
constraint costs from *that object only*. The environment holds no gate, no
verdict and no reference to Core-B; there is nothing here for a veto rate to be
read from even by accident. The frozen field set makes the stronger version of
that guarantee, and ``assert_signal_excludes_core_b`` fires if the set changes.

class EnvironmentSpec:
    """Everything that defines the task, in one auditable record.

    Written into the checkpoint so a policy always carries the environment it was
    trained on. A policy evaluated at a different reference speed from the one it
    learned is not obviously broken from its behaviour, and this is what makes
    the discrepancy visible.

    Attributes:
        step_seconds: Integration step. Matched to the pipeline's fast rate --
            ``1 / estimation.fast_rate_hz``, which is 20 Hz, so 0.05 s.

            It said that and was 0.02 until 5 August 2026, so the plant
            integrated 2.5x faster than the controller driving it assumed. Every
            "simulated time" figure taken through
            :func:`~training.closed_loop.drive_closed_loop` before that date is
            2.5x optimistic -- a 100,000-tick run is 5,000 s of pipeline time and
            was 2,000 s of vehicle motion. The policy also learned a rate of
            change per 0.02 s and was judged by a gate computing jerk over
            0.05 s, which made the gate 2.5x more permissive than training.

            **Changing this invalidates any policy trained before it.** The twin
            is unaffected -- it is self-labelling from kinematics and takes no
            timestep -- and so is the calibration corpus, which drives its own
            sweep at the pipeline rate rather than through this plant.
        episode_steps: Steps before truncation.
        reference_speed_mps: Target speed for the progress reward.
        lane_half_width_m: Normaliser for the lateral offset feature.
        lateral_acceleration_limit_mps2: Comfort limit, and the normaliser for
            the lateral-acceleration feature.
        steer_effectiveness: Lateral acceleration produced per radian of steer.
            This is the ``B`` row of ``twin.control_effectiveness``, and the
            convention is the twin's: ``B . pi = a_lat`` directly, with no step
            factor. Introducing one here would train the policy against a plant
            fifty times less responsive than the one L5 predicts, and every
            proposal would then look like a physics violation to L7b.
        channel_lower: Per-channel lower bounds of the actuation space the
            policy emits into.
        channel_upper: Per-channel upper bounds.
        acceleration_authority_mps2: Longitudinal acceleration at full throttle.
        braking_authority_mps2: Deceleration at full brake. Larger than the
            acceleration authority, as on any real vehicle.
        initial_offset_m: Half-range of the uniform initial lateral offset.
        initial_speed_fraction: Half-range of the uniform initial speed error, as
            a fraction of the reference.
        action_rate_weight: Weight on the squared change in the normalised
            **steering** command between consecutive steps.

            Applied to the steering channel alone. It was written to cover all
            three, and that cost the project a policy: at a weight of 6.0
            against a task reward whose two terms each cap at 1.0, penalising
            throttle and brake rate made a *constant* longitudinal command by
            far the cheapest behaviour available. The cheapest constant one is
            the initial one, and a Gaussian policy starts near a normalised
            action of zero, which on this platform maps to half throttle and
            half brake -- a net 2.5 m/s^2 of deceleration. The vehicle stopped,
            stayed centred, collected the centring reward for the rest of the
            episode, and never had an incentive to move its action again. The
            checkpoint that produced ran an entire 100,000-tick soak without
            the defect being visible, because nothing measured speed. See
            ``docs/SOAK_REPORT.md``.

            Restricting it to steering is not a tuning choice; it is what the
            rest of this entry always said the term was for: C1--C3 are fixed by
            the architecture and none of them bounds how fast the *lateral*
            command may move. L7b does -- ``|a_prop - a_now| / dt <= jerk_max``
            -- and a policy optimised against C1--C3 alone has no reason to
            respect it. Measured rather than assumed: the first policy trained
            here satisfied all three constraints with a mean lane deviation of
            0.10 m and was vetoed by L7b on 100% of ticks, because it reached
            its target lateral acceleration in a single step.

            **Derived from L7b's bound rather than chosen.** Lateral
            acceleration is linear in the steering command --
            ``a_lat = steer x steer_effectiveness`` -- so a penalty on the
            squared change in normalised steer *is* a penalty on the squared
            change in lateral acceleration, up to a constant. The term was
            always the right shape; it was about five hundred times too small.

            The bound: L7b permits ``max_lateral_jerk_mps3 = 8.0`` over a 0.05 s
            tick, so 0.4 m/s^2 of lateral acceleration, so 0.00286 rad of steer,
            so a normalised action change of 0.005714, whose square is
            3.265e-5. At the old weight of 6.0 a step at exactly the limit cost
            2e-4 against a maximum per-step reward of 2.0 -- one part in ten
            thousand, which is inert. The weight is now set so that a step at
            the limit costs **5% of the maximum per-step reward**, which is
            ``0.05 / 3.265e-5``.

            That this was only discovered on 5 August is itself the finding: the
            plant integrated at 0.02 s while the gate computed jerk over 0.05 s,
            so L7b was 2.5x more permissive than configured and the policy's
            steering fitted inside the slack. Correcting the timestep removed
            the slack and exposed a proposer that had never been trained against
            the bound it is judged by.

            **Replacing it with a real jerk penalty was tried and did not
            help.** A term charging ``w x max(0, jerk - 8.0) / 8.0`` per step,
            read from the plant's own lateral acceleration, was measured at two
            weights: at ``w = 1.0`` it swamps a task reward that caps at 2.0 and
            training collapses (return 63, collision rate 1.0); at ``w = 0.1``
            training is healthy (return 897, deviation 0.114 m) and the closed
            loop is *worse* -- a 97% veto rate in the first thousand ticks
            against 36% without it. The term was removed rather than tuned
            further, because the lock it was meant to break is not a property of
            the proposer. See ``docs/SOAK_REPORT.md``.
