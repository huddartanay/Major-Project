"""Driving the real pipeline against the training plant, with the loop closed.

Why this exists
----------------
Every scenario written before this one drove the pipeline open-loop: the harness
published a fixed sensor payload each tick regardless of what the vehicle had
been commanded to do. That is fine for exercising the plumbing, and it silently
invalidates any measurement involving a gate that compares a proposal against
the current state.

Concretely: L7b vetoes when ``|a_proposed - a_current| / dt`` exceeds the jerk
limit. Under an open-loop harness reporting zero lateral acceleration forever,
``a_current`` is pinned at zero, so *every* non-zero proposal is a jerk
violation and the measured veto rate is an artefact of the harness. The first
learned policy measured that way scored a 100% veto rate. The number said
nothing about the policy.

Closing the loop means the plant integrates the command the pipeline actually
issued, and the sensors report the state that produced. Then a veto rate is a
statement about the proposer.

What is still synthetic
------------------------
The plant is :class:`~training.environment.SyntheticDrivingEnv` -- the same
kinematic model the UKF assumes and the twin was fitted to. So this measures
whether the learned policy is *physically admissible on the modelled platform*,
which is a real question with a real answer. It does not measure gate accuracy
under distribution shift, because there is no shift: one set of equations
generates the data and another fitted to the same equations judges it.

published speed and lateral acceleration and nothing else, so ``position_y`` was
never measured -- the UKF propagated it from a heading that is also unobserved,
which is dead reckoning with no correction term. In a 2,000-tick run the estimate
sat at zero while the plant drifted to 2.07 m off a lane 1.75 m wide, and the
estimator error tracked the true deviation to three decimals because the estimate
never moved at all.

Nothing noticed. **The veto rate over those ticks was 0.00 and the Trust Index
was exactly 1.00**, because no gate in Core-B measures where the vehicle is: L7a
bounds speed, lateral acceleration and friction margin; L7b bounds jerk and
divergence from the twin; L6 scores the proposal against the twin. A lane
departure is invisible to all three. The proposer, reading the same estimate,
believed it was centred and had no reason to correct.

    Every modality carries the same payload because the synthetic plant has one

    **Readings are noisy, and were not until 5 August 2026.** Before that this
    published the plant's exact state while declaring non-zero sigmas to the
    filter, so the UKF was told its measurements were uncertain and handed
    perfect ones. Its innovations sat near zero -- a filter with nothing to do.
    Rejecting measurement noise is what a UKF is *for*, and L1's staleness and
    health machinery exists for imperfect streams; no closed-loop run had
    exercised either, including the ones reported as stable over 100,000 ticks.

    The noise source is passed in rather than drawn globally, so a run stays
    reproducible from its seed -- which ``test_a_closed_loop_run_is_reproducible``
    pins.

    **Where an injected fault enters, and why here.** The corruption is applied
    to the payload after the nominal noise and before the publish, so from the

    faulty sensor -- it *is* the same event. Nothing in ``src/astra/`` knows the
    injector exists. See ADR-0022 and :mod:`training.faults`.

    A dropout suppresses **IMU only**. That is the modality
    :meth:`_Extractor.extract_fast` reads, so the fast measurement goes missing
    while the other four streams stay healthy, which exercises L1's
    *per-modality* health machinery rather than blanking the frame. Blanking

        spec: The plant definition. Defaults to :class:`EnvironmentSpec`.
        directory: Where to write the audit log. A temporary directory by
            default.
        observer: Called once per tick with a :class:`TickSample`, after the
            plant has applied the issued command. ``None`` -- the default --
            leaves the loop as it was.
        shadow_fb2: Run FB2 against a twin nothing reads, so the run can report
            what online adaptation would have done. Off by default.
        on_assembled: Called once with the assembled pipeline before the

            to move the cold-path context mid-run so an audience can watch
            a certified profile stop matching. No study uses it: a run that
            mutates its own configuration is not reproducible from its
            seed, which is the property every measurement here rests on.
        ablation: Which layers to disarm, or ``None`` for a governed run.
            A disarmed gate is still constructed and still writes a verdict;
            it simply cannot block, and every decision record says which
            layers were disarmed (ADR-0021).
        single_channel: Drive from the IMU alone, as every run before
            15 August 2026 did. Named rather than expressed as
            ``redundant=None``, because the thing being asked for is *"one
            sensor"* and a caller should have to write that down.
        redundant: Independent per-modality readings, and an optional drift in
            one of them. ``None`` publishes one payload to every modality.
        fault: Sensor faults to inject, with their ground truth. ``None`` -- the
            default -- is a clean run, and is **bit-identical** to a run given
            an injector whose windows fall outside it, because the injector
            draws no randomness when nothing is active. That equality is what
            makes the fault the only difference between two arms of a
            comparison, and it is pinned by a test rather than assumed.
        redundant: Independent per-modality position readings, with an
            optional drift injected into one of them. ``None`` -- the
            default -- publishes one payload to every modality, which is
            what every run before ADR-0026 did and is **bit-identical**,
            because the channels draw from their own generator.
        cold_path: What RCM needs to evaluate the knowledge base. ``None`` --
            the default, and what every run before the first soak used --
            leaves the cold path dormant: the arbitrator keeps its initial
            profile and bounded safe exploration can never engage. That is a
            materially different system from the one the architecture
            describes, so a run that leaves it ``None`` must say so.
        demo_speed_assist: **For the interactive demonstration only.** When the
            failsafe is NOMINAL and the plant's true speed has decayed below
            1 m/s, snap the plant back to its reference speed on the next tick
            so an audience can keep watching the loop react. Off by default,
            which is what every benchmark and pre-registered experiment must
            leave it. Paper runs cannot contain this code path (Stage 0 of the
            19 Sep 2026 handoff): a run that silently re-injects momentum into
            the plant is not the system whose failure mode is under study.
            Only ``demo/dashboard.py`` and ``demo/narrate.py`` pass ``True``;
            a unit test (``tests/unit/test_stage0_demo_flag.py``) enforces that.
