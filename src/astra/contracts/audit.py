"""Audit contracts: the evidence records that make a run certifiable.

NFR8 makes the audit log a certification artefact, not a debugging aid: every
veto, Trust Index, FSM transition and calibration switch must be recorded so a
run can be reconstructed and defended after the fact. Three records carry that
weight.

* :class:`AuditEvent` is the atomic log entry. Its payload is validated to be
  JSON-serialisable *at construction*, so an event that could not become
  evidence fails when it is built, not when the log is written.

* :class:`DecisionRecord` is the explainability unit (finding R-7): for one
  tick it ties together frame health, state estimate, Trust Index, the
  proposal, the twin's prediction, every gate verdict, the FSM snapshot, the
  arbitration decision, the issued command and the configuration hash under
  which all of it happened. It answers "why did the vehicle do that, on what
  evidence, under which calibration" without any model-internal attribution.

* :class:`ExecutionOutcome` closes the loop: the command actually applied, what
  was measured afterwards, and which feedback loops that outcome feeds.

Round-trip guarantee
--------------------
The audit sink writes each record as one JSON line and offline tools read those
lines back as JSON. The property that matters is therefore that a record's
rendered payload is *stable* through serialisation: parsing the JSON and
re-serialising it yields byte-identical output. :meth:`DecisionRecord.to_json`
produces that payload, and it is built from ordered dictionaries of JSON scalars
only -- no sets, no mappings with non-string keys -- so the guarantee holds by
construction rather than by hope.

    proposal is scored, and the record must still faithfully show how far the
    pipeline got. An absent field means "this stage did not run this tick", which
    is itself evidence.

    Attributes:
        run: The run this tick belongs to.
        tick: The tick.
        config_hash: The hash of the frozen configuration in force, so every
            number in the record is attributable to a specific operating point.
        frame_health: Per-modality health of the fused sensor frame, as ordered
            pairs for deterministic rendering.
        fast_state: The UKF fast state estimate.
        fast_innovation: ``||nu_t||`` under the innovation covariance for this
            tick's fast update, or ``None`` if no update ran.

            **The one quantity in the record that can disagree with the

            and L3's Trust Index is computed from it -- and until 9 August 2026
            it reached the evidence log through neither. An auditor could read
            every record of a run and not recover the signal both gates were
            reasoning about.

            Added while measuring OD-9, where the question *"could anything in
            Core-B have seen this fault?"* could not be answered from the

        trust: The Trust Module assessment.
        proposal: The untrusted proposed command.
        prediction: The digital twin's one-step prediction. Two gates score
            against it, so a verdict cannot be reproduced from the record
            without it.
        twin_weights_digest: Which twin produced that prediction. The
            counterpart of ``config_hash``: the twin is not a fixed thing --
            it ships as a checkpoint and FB2 moves it mid-run -- so a record
            that named only the configuration would answer "under which
            operating point" but not "under which model".
        prediction_admissible: Whether the twin's prediction was itself
            admissible. Retained from before L5 existed, when the full
            prediction could not be recorded; it is now derivable from
            ``prediction`` and is kept only because removing a field from an
            evidence schema is a schema-version change, not a tidy-up.
        safety_verdict: Core-B's combined verdict.
        failsafe: The fail-safe FSM snapshot.
        arbitration: RCM's arbitration decision.
        issued: The command actually issued, if one was.
        ablation: Which layers were disarmed for this run, as
            :meth:`~astra.runtime.ablation.AblationProfile.render` produces
            them, or ``"NONE"`` for a governed run.

            **Stamped on every tick, and that is the point.** An ablation study
            produces evidence that looks exactly like a governed run's --
            verdicts, reason codes, a fail-safe trace -- and the difference is
            invisible unless the record carries it. A configuration file
            elsewhere is not enough: evidence outlives the configuration that
