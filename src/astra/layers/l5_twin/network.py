r"""The twin's network and its physics residual.

Why the state is not fed in raw
--------------------------------
The fast estimate is ``[px, py, v, psi, a_lat]``, but the twin is given
``[v, sin(psi), cos(psi), a_lat]``. Two deliberate omissions and one
substitution:

*Position is dropped.* A twin that conditioned its prediction on absolute world
coordinates would learn the route it was trained on rather than the dynamics,
and would produce confident nonsense the first time the vehicle drove somewhere
new. Nothing in the one-step command prediction depends on where the vehicle is,
only on how it is moving.

*Heading enters as its sine and cosine.* Feeding ``psi`` directly puts a
discontinuity at :math:`\\pm\\pi` in the middle of the input space, and the
network would have to spend capacity learning that two numerically distant
inputs describe the same heading. The pair is continuous everywhere and carries
exactly the same information.

The physics residual
--------------------
A plain regressor fits whatever it was shown. The residual below is what makes
this twin *physics-informed*: the command it predicts must be consistent with
the lateral acceleration the vehicle is actually experiencing, through the
platform's configured control effectiveness.

    ``L_phys = (B . pi_hat - a_lat)^2``

``B`` maps a command vector to the lateral acceleration it produces. It is
configuration rather than code because it is a fact about one platform, and
baking it into the layer would put a vehicle assumption inside the core (NFR5).

This is a linearisation and is honestly weaker than the general relation
:math:`a_{lat} = v^2/R`: it ignores the speed dependence of the steering
response. It is nonetheless a real constraint on the prediction, and it is the
constraint that keeps the twin's output physically meaningful when the training
distribution runs out -- which is the situation the whole architecture exists
to survive.

    Deliberately small. The twin sits on the hot path ahead of two gates, and a
    deep network would buy accuracy the architecture cannot spend: the twin's
    job is to be a physically-grounded reference point for the non-conformity
    score, not to be the controller. A large twin that fitted Core-A's policy
    closely would make every score small and quietly disarm the statistical
    gate.

    Why the heads are per context
    -----------------------------
    Two reasons, and the second is the stronger one.

    *Forgetting becomes impossible rather than penalised.* FB2 adapts one head,
    so a rainstorm cannot write to the parameters the highway is read from.
    Before ADR-0019 this was the job of an elastic-weight-consolidation penalty,
    which was measured on 6 August 2026 and found to be a brake rather than a
    consolidator: across every value of its strength, the ratio of forgetting to
    learning was constant to three significant figures. It could not be
    otherwise -- adaptation touched a single 16x2 readout that both contexts used
    in full, so there was no disjoint subspace for a Fisher-weighted penalty to
    protect.

    *The non-conformity score's two operands are now conditioned alike.*
    ``alpha = |pi_prop - pi_hat| / sigma(x)`` is compared against a **per-context**
    conformal quantile, but ``pi_hat`` came from a context-blind twin. L3, L6 and
    L9 are all Mondrian-conditioned on :class:`~astra.kernel.enums.ContextClass`;
    L5 was the only component that was not. This is a correctness fix that would
    be worth making even if forgetting were not a problem.

    :attr:`~astra.kernel.enums.ContextClass.UNCLASSIFIED` gets a head like the
    others and is **never adapted**. It is the pristine offline-trained twin, and
    it is what answers when the context is unknown -- a twin that rewrote itself
    while it could not tell where it was would be the failure mode the whole
    architecture exists to prevent.

    Attributes:
        hidden: The shared trunk. Frozen during adaptation, so every head keeps
