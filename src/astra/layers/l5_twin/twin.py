"""L5 -- the physics-informed digital twin, and why it adapts the way it does.

What this layer is for
----------------------
The twin answers one question per tick: *given the state the vehicle is in, what
command does the modelled physics expect next?* That prediction, ``pi_hat``, is
the right operand of the statistical gate's non-conformity score

    ``alpha = |pi_prop - pi_hat| / sigma(x)``

so the twin is not a diagnostic. It is a safety input, and a twin that drifted
would move the acceptance band under the gate without the gate noticing.

Why the twin must not become a good controller
----------------------------------------------
There is a failure mode here that looks like success. If the twin were trained
until it predicted Core-A's policy accurately, every non-conformity score would
be small, the statistical gate would stop firing, and the system would look
healthy while having disarmed one of its three gates. The twin is trained
against *physics*, not against the proposer, and the physics residual in
:mod:`astra.layers.l5_twin.network` is what keeps it anchored to something the
proposer cannot move.

Why adaptation touches the output layer only
--------------------------------------------
Feedback loop FB2 lets the twin track real changes -- tyre wear, load shifts, a
wet road. The risk is catastrophic forgetting: adapting to rain silently
destroys highway accuracy, and nothing in the pipeline would report it, because
a confidently wrong twin produces confidently wrong scores rather than errors.

Two mechanisms guard against it. Only :attr:`TwinNetwork.output` receives
gradients, so the learned physics representation in the hidden layer is
structurally out of reach of any single context's data. And the update carries
an elastic-weight-consolidation penalty anchored on the Fisher information of a
window of historical samples, so parameters that mattered to earlier contexts
resist being moved.

Neither mechanism is a proof. RK-5 records that EWC may fail to prevent
forgetting in practice, and the validation plan requires an explicit test --
highway accuracy must not degrade after adapting to rain -- rather than an
assumption that the penalty worked.

Determinism
-----------
Weight initialisation is seeded from configuration. A randomly initialised
network would make two runs over identical recorded inputs produce different
predictions, different scores and different verdicts, which would defeat the
byte-exact replay the project built in Phase 2 precisely so that closed-loop
behaviour could be debugged. Assumption A-5 named this as the extension replay
would need once learned components arrived; this is that extension.

Failure policy
--------------
A non-finite prediction raises rather than returning a command. NaN propagating
into the non-conformity score would make the comparison against the conformal
quantile false, which reads as PASS -- a fail-open in a gate input. Raising a
``FAIL_CLOSED`` error turns it into a VETO through the ordinary path.
