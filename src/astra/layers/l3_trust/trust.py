"""L3 -- the conformal Trust Module.

What the Trust Index is, and what it is not
--------------------------------------------
``TI = 1 - F_hat_k(alpha)`` is the proportion of calibration scores for this
context class that are at least as extreme as the current one. High means the
situation resembles what was calibrated; low means it does not.

It is not a probability that the command is safe, and nothing in the system
treats it as one. By SI-4 it never reaches Core-B's verdict: it routes to L4 as
a monitoring signal and to L9 as a routing input. The reason is that a gate
consulting the Trust Index would make its verdict depend on a quantity derived
from the same calibration data the gate itself is scored against, and the two
would fail together.

Why the context classifier is injected
----------------------------------------
Deciding that the vehicle is in ``RAIN_NIGHT`` rather than ``HIGHWAY_CLEAR``
requires knowing about weather and lighting, which are not in the state vector
and which SI-1 forbids this layer from reading off the sensors. The classifier
is therefore supplied by the adapter, exactly as ``MeasurementExtractor`` is for
L2. The core reasons about "the class the classifier returned" and never about
what makes a class.

The uncalibrated case, and a contract that cannot express it
--------------------------------------------------------------
When a class holds too few scores, there is no finite conformal threshold and
:func:`~astra.layers.l3_trust.quantile.conformal_quantile` correctly returns
infinity. :class:`~astra.contracts.assurance.TrustAssessment` cannot carry that:
``class_conditional_quantile`` is validated with ``require_non_negative``, which
rejects a non-finite value.

The quantile is therefore reported as ``0.0`` in that case, which is the
fail-closed reading -- a threshold of zero rejects every non-zero score -- and
matches the project's standing posture that the absence of a verdict is a VETO.
The information is not lost: ``calibration_sample_count`` is recorded on every
assessment, and a reader can recover the distinction exactly by comparing it
against :func:`~astra.layers.l3_trust.quantile.minimum_samples_for`. The helper
:meth:`ConformalTrustModule.is_calibrated` does that comparison.

``TrustAssessment`` now carries an explicit ``is_calibrated`` field, so the
record says which case it is rather than leaving a reader to infer it. The
quantile is still reported as ``0.0`` when uncalibrated -- the contract cannot
carry an infinity -- but that value is no longer the only signal.

In practice the uncalibrated case should not reach the gate during a run: L9
supplies the nearest available calibration table when no class matches, which is
what keeps the tunnel scenario moving rather than halting. The fail-closed
encoding here is the backstop for when it does.
