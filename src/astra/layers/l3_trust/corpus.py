"""Persisted calibration corpora: what a conformal guarantee is made of.

Why a corpus is a first-class artefact rather than a list of numbers
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conformal prediction promises coverage *relative to a calibration set*. The
promise is only as meaningful as the answer to "which set, produced how?", and
that answer has to survive into the evidence archive: a quantile with no
provenance is a threshold somebody chose.

So a corpus carries what it was made from -- the twin's weights digest, the
configuration hash, the generator's seed, the score definition -- alongside the
scores themselves. A reader years later can then tell whether the coverage
number in a report describes the system that produced it.

The exchangeability caveat, stated where it bites
---------------------------------------------------
The coverage guarantee assumes the calibration and test scores are
**exchangeable**. Scores harvested from a control loop are not: consecutive
ticks are autocorrelated, because the vehicle's state moves continuously and the
twin's prediction moves with it.

That is not a defect in this module -- it is the reason ASTRA has more than one
gate, and it is honesty boundary #4. What this module does about it is refuse to
hide it: :func:`coverage_report` measures coverage both ways, on shuffled splits
(exchangeable by construction, so they test the *quantile arithmetic*) and on a
sequential split (autocorrelated, so it tests what the live system actually
faces). A corpus that covers well shuffled and badly sequentially has a real
problem, and reporting only the first number would conceal it.

Why coverage is averaged over many splits
------------------------------------------
A single calibration/validation split is a **noisy estimator**. Measured by
Monte-Carlo on iid data, one split at 500 calibration points has a standard
deviation of about 1.5 percentage points around the nominal 95%. So a single
split landing at 92.6% is an unremarkable 1.6-sigma draw, and reporting it as
"below target" would be a false alarm -- while a single split landing at 96%
would be an equally meaningless pass.

:func:`coverage_report` therefore repeats the split many times and reports the
mean, together with the spread and the worst split seen. The mean is what the
target is applied to; the spread is printed so nobody mistakes a tight result
for a loose one.
