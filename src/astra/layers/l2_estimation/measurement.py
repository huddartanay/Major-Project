"""What the filter is told, and who translates a sensor payload into it.

The domain-independence problem this solves
--------------------------------------------
The filter needs numbers: "the observed speed is 12.4 m/s, with variance 0.05".
The sensor bus carries payloads: a LiDAR return, a CAN frame, a simulator
snapshot. Turning one into the other requires knowing what the payload *is*,
which is exactly the knowledge the core is forbidden to hold (NFR5).

:class:`MeasurementExtractor` is the seam. The adapter that owns the payload type
supplies it; the filter consumes only :class:`Measurement`, which is plain
numbers plus the state dimensions they observe. The result is that L2 contains no
reference to any sensor format, and a new platform is a new extractor rather than
a change to the filter.

Why observations are indices into a named layout
-------------------------------------------------
A general Kalman filter takes an arbitrary observation function ``h(x)``.
:class:`Measurement` restricts that to *selecting a subset of state dimensions*:
GPS observes position, a wheel encoder observes speed, an IMU observes lateral
acceleration. Every measurement the architecture describes is of this form.

The restriction buys a real safety property. An arbitrary callable ``h`` could
observe the wrong dimension and still produce plausible numbers -- the failure
mode the state-vector layouts in :mod:`astra.kernel.constants` exist to prevent.
A measurement therefore carries the *layout* it addresses, so an observation
built for the fast state can never be applied to the slow filter, and the field
names are resolvable for the audit record.

A future sensor needing a genuinely non-linear ``h`` will need this type
extended, and that will be a visible, reviewable change rather than a silent one.

    7.5 it fires on tick 0 of every arm of the fault study *including the
    control*, and on no injected fault but a 25-sigma noise burst (E-105). A
    self-consistent lie produces a small innovation by definition, which is what
    makes it self-consistent.

    What can produce ``FAULTED`` is a **cross-check between modalities that
    measure the same quantity**: the residual of each reading against their
    median. Measured, a drift injected into one of three dissimilar channels
    separates that channel at **5.3x** while the others sit at 1.1x and 2.4x,
    and the largest residual **identifies** the liar rather than merely
    detecting that one exists (E-109).

    Why it is an adapter concern
    ------------------------------
    Deciding that two readings *should* agree requires knowing what each
    modality measures, which is domain knowledge -- and NFR5 keeps domain
    knowledge out of the layers. This protocol therefore sits beside
    :class:`MeasurementExtractor`, is supplied by the same adapter, and is the
    second of the two components permitted to read a raw payload.

    The pipeline merges what this returns with L1's staleness-derived health,
    taking the **worse** of the two per modality. Neither can mask the other: a
    stale channel is stale whatever its values say, and a lying channel is lying
    however punctually it arrives.
