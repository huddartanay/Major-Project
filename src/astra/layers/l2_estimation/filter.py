"""The dual-rate UKF and its innovation monitor.

Why an unscented filter
------------------------
The fast process model is non-linear: heading integrates ``a_lat / v``, and
position integrates ``v`` through trigonometric functions of heading. An extended
Kalman filter would linearise those about the current estimate and accumulate the
error of that approximation exactly where the vehicle is turning hardest -- the
manoeuvres that matter most. The unscented transform propagates a deterministic
set of sigma points through the true non-linear model instead, which is accurate
to second order with no Jacobians to derive, hand-code and get wrong.

The scaled sigma points are van der Merwe's formulation of the Julier-Uhlmann
scaled unscented transform. ``alpha`` controls the spread about the mean,
``beta = 2`` is the standard choice for a Gaussian prior, and ``kappa = 0``
is the usual secondary scaling for a state of this size.

The innovation monitor is not a diagnostic
-------------------------------------------
All three Core-B gates read this filter's output, which the architecture
acknowledges as a genuine common-cause channel: if the filter silently diverges,
all three gates degrade together and their "independence" protects nothing. The
innovation sequence is the one signal that detects that from inside L2, because
it compares what the sensors said against what the model expected -- a
disagreement no downstream consumer of the state can see.

So the monitor is part of the layer. Its Mahalanobis distance raises a
sensor-fault flag above the configured gate, and the rolling innovation
distribution it maintains is the physics-grounded covariate-shift signal that
L6's detector will consume in Phase 5.

Fail-closed numerics
---------------------
A UKF can fail numerically: a covariance can lose positive definiteness through
accumulated round-off, and the Cholesky factorisation inside the sigma-point
generation then raises. That is a state-estimation failure, and a state estimate
that could not be computed must never be silently replaced by the previous one --
downstream gates would validate a command against a stale world. Every numerical
failure here is therefore converted to a :class:`~astra.kernel.errors.SafetyPathError`,
whose disposition is ``FAIL_CLOSED``.
