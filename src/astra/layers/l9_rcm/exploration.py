"""Bounded safe exploration: what the vehicle does when nothing matches.

The behaviour this exists to avoid
------------------------------------
Every runtime-assurance system in the survey degrades to a stop. That is
defensible on a test track and useless on a motorway, where an unexplained halt
in live traffic is itself the hazard. The tunnel scenario is built to force the
question: GPS drops, the context signature moves somewhere no certified profile
covers, and every candidate fails the admissibility conjunction.

The answer here is not to relax the gates. It is to shrink the envelope until
the vehicle's behaviour is defensible *without* a certified profile, and keep
moving inside it.

That sentence was aspirational until ADR-0016. The envelope was tested *before*
the verdict in
:meth:`~astra.layers.l9_rcm.arbiter.RuntimeCalibrationManager.issue`, so
exploration did relax the gates, completely: 99,808 of 100,000 ticks in a soak
run issued the proposal under a blocking verdict. It holds literally now. A gate
with no calibration for the context abstains rather than vetoing, so no verdict
is left for the envelope to work around, and any veto that does survive came
from a gate whose bounds are configuration -- as binding inside the envelope as
outside it.

Why each bound is what it is
-----------------------------
**Speed at half the nearest profile's certified maximum.** Halving is not a
tuning choice dressed as physics -- it is the acknowledgement that the nearest
profile is *not* a match. Its certified limit was established for a context the
vehicle is no longer in, so it bounds nothing directly; halving it buys margin
proportional to the only evidence available.

**No lane changes.** A lane change commits the vehicle to a trajectory it cannot
abandon halfway. Under an uncertified profile the system cannot predict the
outcome well enough to start one.

**Steering within a fixed cone.** Bounds the lateral acceleration reachable in
one tick without needing a friction estimate the situation may not support.

**Evidence logged, and logged nowhere near the safety argument.** Every
``(signature, command, outcome)`` triple is recorded for the offline
certification pipeline that will eventually produce a profile for this context.
None of it feeds a gate. That is SI-10, and it matters here more than anywhere
else in the system: exploration is precisely when the temptation to let the
system calibrate itself out of a corner is strongest, and doing so would mean
the safety argument was written by the situation it was meant to judge.

Exploration ends, and never by halting
----------------------------------------
Four exit conditions, checked in order of severity. Three of them return the
vehicle to normal operation or to a *graduated* fail-safe posture; none of them
is a stop. Reaching HALT remains L8's decision, taken on its own counter, and
this module has no way to cause it directly.
