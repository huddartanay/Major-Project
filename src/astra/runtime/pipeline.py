"""The tick loop: the one place where all ten layers become a system.

Until this module existed the project was ten individually-tested components
with nothing composing them. That gap is what separates "architecture complete"
from "prototype complete", and closing it is what this file does.

The order, and why it is this order
------------------------------------
::

    L1  acquire      fused frame for the tick
    L2  estimate     state + covariance + innovation      (sole state source, SI-2)
    L3  trust        Trust Index from the conformal core
    L4  propose      pi_prop from the untrusted proposer
        ----------- the one-way channel (SI-5) -----------
    L5  predict      pi_hat, the twin's one-step prediction
    L6  statistical  |pi_prop - pi_hat| / sigma(x) against the conformal band
    L7b physical     is the proposal physically reachable
    L7a deterministic three hard bounds from the state alone
        merge        fail-closed aggregation (SI-3)
    L8  fail-safe    posture from the aggregate verdict
    L9  issue        the only component that may command an actuator (SI-7)
        record       one DecisionRecord, one audit row

Two orderings here are load-bearing rather than incidental.

**The proposal crosses the channel before any gate sees it.** It would be
simpler to hand the `ProposedCommand` straight from L4 to L6. Going through
`ProposalWriter`/`ProposalReader` costs a queue round-trip and buys the property
the channel exists for: Core-A holds an endpoint with no read method, so the
topology in the running system is the topology the safety argument describes. A
pipeline that bypassed the channel would pass every test the channel has while
making the invariant it enforces vacuous.

**The shield is evaluated last but is not privileged.** L7a runs after the other
two purely so that a reader of this file meets the gates in the order the paper
lists them. It has no more authority in the merge than any other gate --
`Verdict.merge` is fail-closed and symmetric, and giving one gate a distinguished
position in the aggregation is exactly what SI-3 forbids.

Fail-closed, everywhere
-----------------------
Every stage that can raise is wrapped. A gate that throws becomes a VETO from
that gate; a stage before the gates that throws ends the tick with an empty
verdict set, which `Verdict.merge` also reads as a VETO. There is no path
through this function that produces an issued command without three gate
verdicts, and no exception escapes as anything other than a recorded VETO.

That is why the fail-closed behaviour is *structural* here rather than a policy
each caller must remember: the tick either produces a `DecisionRecord` naming
what stopped it, or it produces one naming the command it issued.

What this module does not do
-----------------------------
It does not construct anything. Every layer arrives through the constructor,
already built, because the composition root is the only place that decides what
a layer *is* -- and a tick loop that could build its own gate could build a
different one than the one the configuration describes.

It does not drive itself. There is no thread, no timer and no sleep: the caller
decides when a tick happens. A simulator advances on its own clock, a replay
advances through recorded instants, and a live run advances on a real one. A
loop that owned its own timing would be unable to serve all three.

    Deliberately not part of :class:`~astra.contracts.audit.DecisionRecord`. The
    audit log is a certification artefact and describes what the system did; a
    counterfactual produced by a loop that is switched off is a different kind of
    claim, and filing the two together would be a category error that a reader
    years from now has no way to unpick.

    Attributes:
        divergence: The largest absolute per-channel difference between the
            prediction the live twin made and the one the shadow would have made.
            Zero until the shadow's first consolidation fires.
        digest: The shadow twin's weights digest, so a run can show the shadow
            actually moved rather than assuming it did.

            False on a tick that issued nothing, or one with no context to adapt
            in -- both are cases FB2 would also have skipped.
        quantile: The conformal quantile L6 actually used this tick -- static,
            because the corpus is seeded once and never updated.
        shadow_quantile: The quantile L6 *would* have used had FB3 been
            requantilising online on realised scores. **The FB3 counterfactual.**
        shadow_would_veto: Whether this tick's score exceeds that shadow
            quantile. Summed over a run it gives the veto rate FB3 would have
            produced.
        shadow_failsafe: The state a *second* fail-safe machine reaches when fed
            those counterfactual vetoes and nothing else.

            This is what answers D-1. A veto is not an intervention: it runs the
            fallback for one tick and nothing degrades until the OOD counter
            crosses theta-1. So "false-positive rate" has two readings -- per
            tick, which is epsilon by construction and not a defect, and per
            *intervention*, which is what a fleet operator actually pays for.
            They are not the same number and the target of < 1% never said
            which it meant.
        live_score: The non-conformity score L6 computed this tick, against the
            twin the gates actually read.
        shadow_score: The score L6 *would* have computed had it read the shadow
            twin instead. The pair is the whole question about FB2: the twin's
            module docstring says training it on the proposer's output would
            "make every score small and quietly disarm the statistical gate",
            and FB2's only labels are the proposer's commands. If the shadow's
            scores fall away from the live ones over a long run, that is the
            disarming, observed before it was ever given authority.

            Both are computed with
            :func:`~astra.layers.l6_statistical_gate.gate.non_conformity_score`,
            the gate's own arithmetic, because a comparison against a
            reimplementation would be evidence about the reimplementation.

                the thresholds, and the three signature components the pipeline

                movement would have been an improvement, before FB2 is given any
                authority over a command. ``None``, the default, runs no shadow.

                The idiom is L9's, not a new one -- :class:`ShadowExecution`
                stages a candidate calibration profile and measures its
                divergence before committing to it, for the same reason.
            ablation: Which layers were disarmed for this run, rendered by
                :meth:`~astra.runtime.ablation.AblationProfile.render`.
                ``"NONE"`` -- the default -- is a governed run. Carried here
                only so that every decision record can be stamped with it: an
                ablated run's evidence is otherwise indistinguishable from a
                governed run's, which is precisely what an ablation is
                (ADR-0021).
            shadow_failsafe: A second fail-safe machine, driven only by the
                counterfactual verdicts FB3's quantile would have produced. It
                governs nothing. It exists to answer D-1's real question: a veto
                runs the fallback for one tick, and nothing degrades until the
                OOD counter crosses theta-1, so the per-tick veto rate and the
                per-*intervention* rate are different numbers.
            shadow_calibration: A second Mondrian calibration, seeded from the
                same corpus as L6's, which **is** fed realised scores. Nothing
                thresholds against it. It answers FB3's question -- what would
                the acceptance quantile become, and what veto rate would that
                have produced -- without FB3 having any say in a verdict.

        cold path last means a slow arbitration delays the next tick's start
        rather than this tick's command.

        chooses which calibration to run *under*; failing to choose leaves the
        previous choice in force, which is a degraded but safe state. Letting it
        abort a tick would give the cold path authority over the hot one --
        exactly the coupling SI-8 exists to prevent.
