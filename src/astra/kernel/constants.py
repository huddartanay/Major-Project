"""Architectural constants: values fixed by the design, not by configuration.

The constant / configuration distinction
----------------------------------------
This module holds only values that cannot change without changing the
architecture itself. Changing ``RCS_DIMENSION`` from 5 to 6 is not a tuning
exercise; it invalidates every certified profile's centroid and covariance in
the Calibration Knowledge Base and requires re-certification. Such a value
belongs in source, under review, with a git history.

Everything with a *threshold* character -- the OOD counter thresholds
theta-1/2/3, the conformal significance level epsilon, the trust admissibility
threshold tau, the CDI limit delta_CDI, speed caps, the innovation Mahalanobis
gate gamma -- is **not** here. Those are operating points, they differ between
the development, simulation and certification environments, and a safety
engineer must be able to change them without a code review. They live in
:mod:`astra.config`.

The test for which module a value belongs in is: *if this value changed, would
the change be reviewed by a software engineer or by a safety engineer?*
Software engineer means here; safety engineer means configuration.

A note on the absence of thresholds
-----------------------------------
The source documents never assign numeric values to theta-1, theta-2, theta-3,
epsilon, gamma, tau or delta_CDI. That is not an oversight in the documents --
those values can only be fixed empirically once the pipeline runs. Phase 1
therefore provides the *typed, validated, documented slot* for each of them and
deliberately supplies no default that could be mistaken for a certified value.
See ``docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md``, assumption A-4.

# insurance against an unreadable evidence archive.

AUDIT_SCHEMA_VERSION: Final = 10
"""Schema version stamped on every audit record. Increment on any field change.

Version 2 (ADR-0016) widened the verdict vocabulary: a gate verdict may now read
``ABSTAIN`` as well as ``PASS`` or ``VETO``. No field was added or removed, so a
version-1 reader will parse a version-2 record structurally -- and will
mis-classify an abstention, most likely as an unrecognised veto. That is exactly
the failure the version field exists to make loud rather than silent.

Version 3 (9 August 2026) adds ``fast_innovation`` to the decision record: the
Mahalanobis distance of the tick's fast innovation. The quantity was always
computed -- L6's covariate-shift window is fed from it and L3's Trust Index is
derived from it -- and reached the archive through neither, so a run's evidence
did not contain the one number in the pipeline that can *disagree* with the
state estimate. Added while measuring OD-9, where the question "could anything
in Core-B have seen this fault?" turned out to be unanswerable from the archive.

A version-2 reader parses a version-3 record structurally and will not see the
new key. That is the benign direction: it loses a signal rather than
misinterpreting one, unlike the version-1/2 boundary above.

Version 4 (9 August 2026) adds ``ablation``, naming which layers were disarmed
for the run. Unlike version 3 this boundary is **not** benign in the reading
direction: a version-3 reader sees an ablated run's records as a governed
run's, because every other field is identical by construction -- that is what
an ablation *is*. The version field is the only thing standing between an
ablation study and a certification artefact describing a system that was not
running, which is why ADR-0021 stamps the profile per tick rather than once
per run.

Version 5 (10 August 2026) adds ``previous_digest`` to every record, making
the evidence log a hash chain and therefore **tamper-evident** rather than
merely integrity-checked -- N-10, and the cheapest item in the threat model
written the same day. A version-4 reader ignores the field and loses only the
ability to detect tampering it could not detect before.

Version 6 (11 August 2026) adds ``integrity_counter`` to the fail-safe snapshot
(ADR-0024). The machine now escalates on two independent counters -- one for
sustained refusal, one for sustained sensor unhealth -- and the state alone no
longer says which. **This boundary is asymmetric in an interesting way.** A
version-5 reader loses only the new field, so it reads a DEGRADED posture and
cannot tell whether the gates refused or a sensor went dark; that is a loss of
attribution, not a misreading. But the *converse* matters more for a safety
case: every record written before version 6 was produced by a machine that
could not escalate on sensor health at all, so a version-5 archive showing
NOMINAL throughout a sensor fault is **correct about what that machine did** and
must not be compared against a version-6 archive as though the two were the same
system. That is precisely the OD-9 evidence (E-46), and the version field is
what keeps it from being quietly re-interpreted.

Version 7 (11 August 2026) adds ``signature`` to the arbitration decision: the
five-component runtime context signature RCM actually decided on. **It was
computed every cold-path evaluation, searched the knowledge base with, decided
on, and archived nowhere** -- so a record could say ``SAFE_EXPLORATION, trust
0.62`` and could not say what context produced it. The one question a reader of
an arbitration record most wants to ask was unanswerable from the archive
(OD-14).

Third time this shape has appeared: ``fast_innovation`` at version 3, and
``previous_digest`` at version 5 were both quantities the pipeline had and the
evidence did not. A version-6 reader loses the field and is back to not being
able to answer the question, which is the benign direction.

Version 8 (11 August 2026) adds ``integrity_counter`` to the fail-safe snapshot,
and it is the **fourth** instance of that shape in five versions. ADR-0024 gave
the machine two counters four days earlier and argued they must be reported
separately -- *"one integer cannot say which happened"* -- and the field went
onto the snapshot and not onto the record. So every archive between schema 6 and
8 carries that argument's conclusion and none of its evidence: a DEGRADED
posture with no way to tell whether the gates refused or a sensor went dark
(OD-16).

Found by the tool built to *read* the evidence, which is the same way OD-14 was
found one version earlier. A pipeline that computes a number is not a pipeline
whose evidence has it, and the only reliable way to notice is to try to use the
archive for something.

Version 9 (15 August 2026) adds ``withdrawn_capabilities`` to the fail-safe
snapshot (ADR-0029). The machine gained a second **axis**: ``state`` records how
bad things were getting, this records *what was broken*, and the two are
independent -- a version-9 row can read ``NOMINAL`` with lane changes withdrawn,
which no earlier schema could express. A version-8 reader loses the field, and
must not read its absence as *nothing was withdrawn*: it means nobody was asked.

Version 10 (15 August 2026) adds ``sensor_decay`` and
``sensors_needing_service`` (ADR-0031). **Every other number in this record
resets when the trouble passes**, which is right for a posture and useless for a
sensor. Measured: a camera dark on alternate frames for a full minute held the
integrity counter at **1** and the posture at ``NOMINAL``, because that counter
moves +1 and -1 and any duty cycle at or below 50% nets to zero however long it
runs (E-135, OD-21). ``sensor_decay`` is the duty cycle that counter cancels
out, per modality.

The reading direction is benign -- a version-9 reader loses two fields -- but the
*archive* direction is the point: a fleet's version-9 logs cannot be mined for
sensor wear at all, because the quantity was never written down. That is the
fifth instance of the shape at version 3, 5, 7 and 8, and the first where the
missing quantity was not merely uncomputed but unrepresentable."""
