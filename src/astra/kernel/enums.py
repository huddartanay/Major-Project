"""The canonical vocabulary of ASTRA.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Across the four ASTRA source documents the same concept appears under several
spellings: ``Nominal`` / ``NOMINAL``, ``highway_clear`` / ``HIGHWAY-CLEAR``,
``PASS/VETO`` / ``pass/veto``. In a system whose primary evidence artefact is an
audit log, a concept that serialises three different ways is a concept that
cannot be queried, and therefore cannot be used as certification evidence.

This module fixes one spelling for every term in the architecture. Every later
phase imports these enumerations rather than declaring string literals, so the
event log, the dashboard, the calibration knowledge base and the test suite all
agree by construction.

Design decision: ``StrEnum`` rather than ``Enum`` or ``IntEnum``
----------------------------------------------------------------
* ``StrEnum`` (Python 3.11+) members *are* strings, so ``json.dumps`` emits
  ``"VETO"`` with no custom encoder. The audit log stays human-readable, which
  matters because a human safety assessor is one of its consumers.
* ``IntEnum`` was rejected: it serialises to ``2``, which is unreadable in a log
  and silently comparable to unrelated integers.
* A plain ``Enum`` was rejected: it needs a custom JSON encoder in every writer,
  and a forgotten encoder becomes a crash on the audit path.

Trade-off accepted: ``StrEnum`` members compare equal to their string value, so
``Verdict.VETO == "VETO"`` is ``True``. This slightly weakens type safety, but
it is what makes round-tripping through JSONL and TOML free. mypy still rejects
passing a bare ``str`` where a ``Verdict`` is declared.

    to choose between two lies -- a PASS asserting the proposal satisfied a
