"""The configuration schema: every operating point, validated and typed.

The rule that shapes this whole module
--------------------------------------
**No safety threshold has a default.** The source documents never assign a
numeric value to theta-1/2/3, epsilon, gamma, tau or delta_CDI, and that is not
an oversight: those values can only be fixed empirically once the pipeline runs
against real scenarios. Shipping a plausible-looking default would let a run
proceed under a threshold nobody chose and nobody reviewed, and the resulting
number would then appear in a report as though it meant something.

So a missing safety threshold is a startup failure. That is assumption A-4, and
it is the single most important property of this file. Non-safety values --
log levels, directories, filter rates, buffer sizes -- do carry defaults,
because a wrong default there is an inconvenience rather than an unsound safety
claim.

Why pydantic here and frozen dataclasses elsewhere
--------------------------------------------------
Configuration is parsed once, at startup, from text a human wrote. That is
exactly the boundary pydantic is for: rich validation, and error messages that
name the file, the field and the constraint. The hot path never touches these
objects' validators again -- the settings are frozen after load and read as
plain attributes, which is O(1) and allocation-free.

Non-SI units at the boundary, SI everywhere else
------------------------------------------------
Humans write ``50`` for milliseconds and ``20`` for km/h; the pipeline computes
in seconds and m/s. Fields that a human authors are therefore named with their
non-SI unit (``staleness_budget_ms``) and exposed through an accessor that
converts once (:meth:`SensingSettings.staleness_budget`). The conversion happens
here, at the boundary, and never again -- which is the unit policy, applied to
configuration.

            safety claim: that nothing the safety argument depends on reads it.
            Get it wrong and the vehicle drives on a dead sensor it needed.

            **Every shipped profile lists all five**, which is exactly the
            behaviour before this field existed. The prototype deliberately does
            **not** use the escape hatch it provides: its extractor happens to
            read only the IMU, so declaring the other four non-critical would be
            *true of this build* -- and true only because of OD-15, which is a
            defect to fix rather than a property to encode in a safety file
            (ADR-0028).
        integrity_tolerated_faults: How many modalities may be unhealthy
            *simultaneously* before the integrity counter rises. **No
            default** (A-4), and **zero is the only value a deployment
            without redundancy may set**.

            Raising it above zero is a *claim*: that the sensor set carries
            enough independent measurements of each quantity to keep working
            with that many of them lying, and that something excludes the
            liar from the fusion. A deployment fusing three position
            channels by median tolerates one; a deployment with one channel
            per quantity tolerates none, and setting one there would mean
            ignoring the only sensor it has (ADR-0027).
        capabilities: What each autonomy function requires, as
            ``{name: modalities}``. A function is **withdrawn** for as long as
            any modality it requires is worse than ``HEALTHY``.

            **This is the second axis, and it is orthogonal to everything above
            it.** The thresholds and ``critical_modalities`` answer *how bad is
            this getting* with a severity level; this answers *what is broken*
            with a set of lost functions. One integer cannot hold both, and
            ADR-0029 is the record of finding that out: before it, a camera
            fault could stop the vehicle or do nothing at all, and could not do
            the one useful thing -- stop offering lane changes and drive on.

            The two axes compose by **intersection**: a capability is available
            only where the posture allows it *and* its sensors support it.
            Withdrawal can therefore only ever subtract. A capability set that
            could *grant* something the posture forbids would be a fourth gate
            with veto-override authority, which SI-3 forbids.

            Being orthogonal to ``critical_modalities`` is the point. A camera
            may be non-critical -- never a reason to slow down -- *and* required
            by ``lane_change``, so losing it withdraws lane changes and leaves
            the vehicle driving. Neither field alone can express that.

            The names are **opaque to L8**, which is what keeps NFR5: the layer
            knows that capabilities exist and get withdrawn, never what a lane
            is. Only a domain adapter reads the names.

            **Defaults to empty**, and that is not an A-4 exception. An empty
            ``critical_modalities`` would disable a counter that already
            escalates, so it is a fail-open claim and is refused. An empty
            ``capabilities`` withdraws nothing, which is precisely the behaviour
            shipped before this field existed -- an absence of a claim rather
            than a weak one. ``benchmarks/commissioning.py`` prints the
            resulting degradation table, so a deployment that declared none can
            see that it declared none.

    **Why there are two sets of thresholds, and why the second set is tighter.**
    The ``ood_*`` thresholds answer *"how long should sustained refusal be
    tolerated?"*, and their floor is set by a legitimate recovery: a vehicle 1 m
    off the lane centre needs ~21 vetoed ticks to correct, so a threshold below
    that turns a correction into a pull-over. The ``integrity_*`` thresholds
    answer a different question -- *"how long should a sensor channel be allowed
    to say nothing?"* -- and it has no legitimate answer above a fraction of a
    second. There is no benign reason for a modality to stop publishing.

    Sharing one set would have forced the tighter question to accept the looser
    answer, and measured (E-46) the loose answer is too slow: the vehicle leaves
    its corridor 73 ticks after an IMU dropout opens, and ``ood_threshold_halt``
    is 100. See ADR-0024.
