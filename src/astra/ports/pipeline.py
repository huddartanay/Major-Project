"""The interface each of the nine pipeline layers implements.

Why ports exist before any layer does
-------------------------------------
Phase 1 deliberately ships no layer logic. It ships the *shape* of every layer,
for three reasons that all pay off later.

1. **The dependency graph is fixed now.** With every layer expressed as a
   protocol over contracts, the composition root can wire a pipeline out of
   fakes before a single UKF exists, and the architecture fitness contracts have
   something concrete to constrain. A port added after its implementation is a
   description of what was built; a port added before is a decision about what
   may be built.

2. **Substitutability is the testing strategy.** Every exit criterion in the
   roadmap is of the form "layer X validated in isolation before it is wired to
   anything". That is only possible if X's collaborators can be replaced by
   trivial stand-ins. These protocols are structural, so a five-line fake in
   ``tests/`` satisfies one with no inheritance and no registration.

3. **The unit policy is enforced at the boundary.** No signature here mentions
   a non-SI type: :data:`~astra.kernel.units.KilometresPerHour` and
   :data:`~astra.kernel.units.Degrees` exist so human-facing values are visible
   in configuration and adapters, and an architecture test asserts they never
   reach a port.

Design decision: ``Protocol``, not an abstract base class
---------------------------------------------------------
Structural typing keeps the dependency arrow pointing the right way. An adapter
implementing :class:`SensorSource` does not import an ASTRA base class, so the
CARLA adapter never inherits from the core and the core never learns that CARLA
exists. That is what makes the R-6 interpreter problem a deployment detail
rather than an architectural one, and what delivers the domain independence
NFR5 demands.

Protocols are ``@runtime_checkable`` where the check is cheap and useful --
which for a protocol means an ``isinstance`` test of *method presence only*,
never of signatures. The composition root uses it as a wiring sanity check, not
as a substitute for type checking.

Separation invariants visible in these signatures
-------------------------------------------------
* :class:`CommandProposer` (L4, Core-A) takes state and trust, and returns a
  proposal. It is given no verdict, no FSM state and no calibration table, so
  the one-way channel of SI-5 is expressed in the type, not just the wiring.
* :class:`DeterministicShield` (L7a) takes *only* the state estimate. It cannot
  see the twin's prediction or the statistical gate's score, which is what makes
  its veto structurally independent (R-3).
* No gate protocol receives a :class:`~astra.contracts.assurance.TrustAssessment`,
  which is SI-4 in signature form.
