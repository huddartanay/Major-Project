"""The separation invariants SI-1 ... SI-10, as data and as runtime guards.

Why the invariants are a data structure
---------------------------------------
The architecture's first objective is *formally defined separation invariants*,
and the implementation plan is explicit that they must be machine-checked --
"verify this with a code-level check (no import, no shared memory region, no
queue), not just a comment". Prose in a design document cannot fail a build.

This module makes each invariant a value: identifier, statement, rationale,
what happens if it is violated, and how it is enforced. That buys three things a
document cannot. The CLI can print the catalogue, so an assessor can see the
safety argument and its enforcement status without reading the source. The
composition root verifies the catalogue at startup, so a malformed or
depopulated safety argument stops the run. And the architecture tests assert
properties *of the catalogue itself* -- that every invariant has an enforcement
mechanism, that none is silently downgraded to review-only -- which is what
stops the argument eroding under deadline pressure.

Enforcement honesty
-------------------
:class:`EnforcementKind` distinguishes what is actually checked from what is
merely asserted. An invariant marked :attr:`EnforcementKind.REVIEW` is one the
codebase does *not* mechanically enforce yet, and it says so rather than
implying a guarantee it cannot make. Several invariants here are review-only in
Phase 1 because the components they constrain do not exist yet; each names the
phase that upgrades it. Overstating enforcement would be exactly the kind of
unbacked claim the project's honesty boundaries forbid.

The two runtime guards
----------------------
Most invariants are enforced statically -- by import contracts, by a type that
makes the illegal state unrepresentable. Two need a runtime check as well, and
they are the two whose violation is catastrophic and whose trigger is dynamic:
:func:`guard_verdict_aggregation` (SI-3) and :func:`guard_actuation_authority`
(SI-7).
