"""The pipeline, live, with a button that breaks a sensor.

P4.1 and P4.2 in one server
-----------------------------
P4.1 asks for the pipeline rendered as itself: the Trust Index, the three gates
lit separately, the fail-safe state machine, and an event ticker. P4.2 asks that
an audience be able to **press the button** -- *"a demo where the observer
chooses the fault cannot be staged."* They are the same program, because the
second is only convincing while the first is running.

The rule P4.1 states, and how it is made structural
-----------------------------------------------------
*"Every number on screen must trace to a live ``DecisionRecord``. Nothing
scripted, nothing interpolated."*

A promise like that decays. So :class:`Frame` is a **pure projection**: it is
built from a :class:`~training.closed_loop.TickSample` and nothing else, it
computes no value the pipeline did not, and
``tests/unit/test_dashboard_frame.py`` asserts field by field that each one
equals its source. There is no code path in this module that can put a number on
screen that the pipeline did not produce.

The one deliberate exception, and why it is the point
------------------------------------------------------
Two fields -- :attr:`Frame.truth_y` and :attr:`Frame.truth_speed` -- come from
the **simulator**, not the record. They are what the vehicle is actually doing,
which no deployed system knows.

They are on screen because **OD-9 is invisible without them.** The finding is
that a sensor fault drives the estimate and the truth apart while every gate
stays green: the vehicle goes 4.199 m off a 1.75 m lane and the corridor bound
reads 0.023 m (E-46, E-48). A dashboard showing only what the system knows would
render that as a completely nominal run, which is exactly the problem being
demonstrated.

So they are carried in a separate group, labelled *ground truth (simulator
only)* on the page, and :attr:`Frame.from_record` names which is which. Mixing
them would turn the most honest thing this demo has into its most misleading.

What to demonstrate, and what not to
--------------------------------------
The honest demonstration is **not** "watch the gates catch it". As of 10 August
they do not: `imu_dropout` and `position_drift` both put the vehicle outside its
corridor with a verdict trace identical to the clean run's. The demonstration is
that divergence, live, with the gate panel staying green throughout -- and then
the same run with the fault closed.

Do not wait for OD-9 to be fixed before showing this. A demo of a system whose
weakness you can name is worth more than a demo of one whose weakness you have
not looked for.

Why there is no web framework here
------------------------------------
Server-Sent Events over :mod:`http.server`, and a single static page with no
build step. ``PENDING.md`` specified FastAPI, WebSockets, React and Recharts;
this uses none of them and adds **no dependency at all**.

That is not laziness, it is the same argument P4.3 just made in anger. FilterPy
was removed because an unmaintained dependency inside a safety repository is a
qualification argument nobody wants to write, and it dragged scipy, matplotlib
and pillow behind it. Adding a Node toolchain and a ``node_modules`` tree to that
repository -- for a *demo* -- would contradict the discipline that makes the rest
of it credible. Telemetry is one-way, which is precisely what SSE is for, and
the fault button is a POST.

The fallback run, which P4.2 asks for by name
-----------------------------------------------
*"Capture a pre-recorded fallback run before any live demonstration."*

``--record`` writes every frame to JSONL while driving; ``--replay`` streams a
recording back at the same rate, with the fault buttons disabled because the
faults already happened. The page cannot tell the difference and neither can an
audience, which is the point: a laptop that will not cooperate in the room
should cost a demonstration its interactivity, not its evidence.

A recording is exactly the frames the live run produced -- the same projection,
so a replay is as traceable to `DecisionRecord`s as the run that made it.

Run it with::

    uv run python -m demo.dashboard
    uv run python -m demo.dashboard --port 8080 --ticks 4000
    uv run python -m demo.dashboard --ticks 3000 --record var/demo/fallback.jsonl
    uv run python -m demo.dashboard --replay var/demo/fallback.jsonl

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

    Attributes:
        tick: The control tick.
        trust_index: L3's Trust Index, or ``None`` if L3 did not run.
        context: The Mondrian class L3 assigned.
        gates: ``(gate, verdict, reason_code)`` per gate that reported, in the
            order Core-B evaluated them. The three-gate panel is lit from this
            and from nothing else.
        blocking: Whether Core-B's combined verdict blocked.
        failsafe_state: L8's state.

        speed_cap: The cap L8 is imposing, in m/s, or ``None`` when it is
            imposing none. Never zero for absent -- a zero cap is a
            commanded stop and would be read as one.
        origin: How the issued command was labelled -- ``PROPOSED``,
            ``RATE_LIMITED``, ``SPEED_CAPPED``, or absent if none was issued.
        issued: The command that reached the actuation sink.
        quantile: The conformal quantile L6 thresholded against.
        innovation: The fast innovation's Mahalanobis distance. **Not actually
            a Mahalanobis distance** -- see OD-10 -- and labelled on the page
            with that caveat rather than without it.
        arbitration: RCM's outcome -- ``CONTINUE``, ``SHADOW_EXECUTION``,
            ``SWITCH_COMMITTED``, ``ROLLBACK`` or ``SAFE_EXPLORATION`` -- or
            ``None`` before the first cold-path evaluation.
        active_profile: The calibration profile currently in force.
        candidate_profile: The profile being shadow-executed, if any.
        arbitration_trust: RCM's score for the active profile against the
            current context signature.
        divergence_index: The Calibration Divergence Index during shadow
            execution.
        exploring: Whether bounded safe exploration is engaged. **The
            architectural differentiator**: an unrecognised context narrows
            the envelope instead of stopping the vehicle.
        ablation: Which layers were disarmed. ``"NONE"`` for a governed run.

        estimate_y: Where the *system believes* it is, laterally.
        truth_y: **Ground truth, simulator only.** Where the vehicle actually
            is. No deployed system has this, and it is on screen because OD-9
