"""All ten layers, composed, running ticks end to end.

Until the tick loop existed the project was ten individually-tested components
with nothing joining them. These tests assert the property that arrival buys:
a command leaves the proposer, crosses the one-way channel, meets three gates,
passes through the fail-safe machine, reaches the arbitrator and lands in the
audit log as one complete evidence row.

They also assert the thing that matters more than "it runs" -- that the gates
still *discriminate* once composed. A pipeline where every tick passes is
indistinguishable from a pipeline with no gates at all.
