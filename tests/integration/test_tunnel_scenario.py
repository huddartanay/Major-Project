"""The tunnel: a context no certified profile covers, and the vehicle keeps moving.

This is the behaviour that most distinguishes ASTRA from the systems in its
prior-art table. Those degrade to a halt when they leave their certified
envelope. ASTRA is built not to: with no admissible profile, RCM engages bounded
safe exploration -- half the nearest certified speed, inside a +/-15 degree
steering cone, no lane changes, evidence logged -- and the vehicle continues.

What these tests assert, and what they do not
-----------------------------------------------
They assert the *mechanism*: that an out-of-envelope context is detected, that
the envelope narrows, that it widens again on the way out, and that no tick in
between fails to issue a command.

They do not assert that the vehicle drives *well* in a tunnel. It is running a
deterministic placeholder policy against a synthetic vehicle; "keeps moving
safely through an unmodelled context" is a claim that needs the trained policy
and a real simulator. What is demonstrated is that the architecture's answer to
an unrecognised context is a narrowed envelope rather than a stop.
