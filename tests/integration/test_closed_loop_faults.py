"""An injected fault driven through the assembled pipeline, end to end.

What this file is for
----------------------
``tests/unit/test_fault_injection.py`` shows the injector corrupts a dictionary.
That is necessary and it is not the claim. The claim is that a fault injected at
the sensor boundary **arrives** -- that it reaches the estimator, that the
pipeline's behaviour changes because of it, and that the ground truth recorded
alongside it describes what actually happened rather than what was requested.

An injector verified only against its own return value is the same defect as the
fail-safe speed cap that was recorded on every capped tick and reached no
actuator (OD-2). Both would pass every unit test written about them. The thing
that caught the speed cap was a test that drove the *assembled* pipeline into
HALT and asserted the brake, and this file is the same move.

The two tests that carry the weight
------------------------------------
:func:`test_a_clean_run_and_an_injector_that_never_opens_are_the_same_run`
    The isolation property, and the one that makes a comparison possible at all.
    Two arms of a fault study must differ by the fault and by nothing else. If
    the injector perturbed the sensor-noise stream merely by existing, every
    reading after tick zero would differ between the arms and no difference in
    outcome could be attributed to the fault. This asserts equality of the whole
    trace, not a tolerance.

:func:`test_a_position_bias_arrives_at_the_estimator`
    The mutation test the flake harness's lesson demands: it fails on an
    injector that has silently become a no-op, because it measures the
    estimator's error against the plant's *truth* rather than anything the
    injector reports about itself. A no-op injector leaves that error where the
    clean run leaves it.
