"""The learned policy driving the real pipeline, with the loop closed.

Why the loop being closed is the whole point
----------------------------------------------
Under an open-loop harness -- one that publishes a fixed sensor payload every
tick regardless of what the vehicle was commanded to do -- L7b's jerk check
compares each proposal against a lateral acceleration pinned at zero. Every
non-zero proposal is then a jerk violation, and the measured veto rate is a
property of the harness. Measured that way the first trained policy scored 100%.
Closed-loop, on the same checkpoint, it is a single tick in four hundred.

That is recorded here rather than quietly fixed because the same mistake is
available to anyone who writes the next scenario.

What these tests assert
------------------------
That a genuinely learned policy is admissible on the modelled platform and that
the architecture's availability claim survives contact with one. They do not
assert a gate accuracy figure: the plant, the twin and the calibration corpus
all descend from the same kinematic equations, so there is no distribution shift
here for the statistical gate to be right or wrong about.
