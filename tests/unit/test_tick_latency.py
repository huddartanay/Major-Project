"""The full-tick latency benchmark's arithmetic and its verdict text.

Why this file exists at all
-----------------------------
Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one.

**It checks the statistics.** A percentile helper that is quietly off by one
produces a latency figure that looks entirely plausible, which is the failure
mode this project has met four times (C-4) and has a name for.

**It puts the module under `mypy --strict`.** ``files = ["src", "tests"]``, so a
benchmark is type-checked only if a test imports it. A benchmark nobody imports
is a benchmark whose types nobody checks -- and on 16 August 2026 a change to
``benchmarks/whiteness.py`` broke its own ``--sweep`` path, caught only because
a test happened to import the module. Every benchmark carrying a number this
project quotes should be in scope, and importing it here is what puts it there.

The verdict tests are the interesting ones. The tool has to say something
different depending on whether the budget was met at the tail, at the median, or
not at all, and *saying the reassuring thing when the tail is bad* is precisely
the mistake the latency figures in this project have already made once.
