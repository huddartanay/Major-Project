"""Does the first-party UKF do what the one it replaced did?

Why this file exists
---------------------
L2 ran on FilterPy for the project's whole life, and FilterPy's outputs are what
`EVIDENCE.md` rests on. Replacing it is therefore not a refactor -- it is a
change to the thing every gate reads, and the risk is not that it breaks loudly
but that it agrees to nine decimal places and disagrees on the tenth, at exactly
one threshold crossing, in a run nobody re-measures.

Two kinds of test answer that, and both are needed:

**Against the mathematics**, here. The unscented transform of a linear map *is*
that map, so on a linear system ``predict`` has a closed form to check against
that owes nothing to FilterPy or to this implementation -- the check that would
survive both being wrong in the same way.

Writing that test found something. The *update* does **not** reproduce the
linear Kalman filter, because it reuses the sigma points ``predict`` pushed
through ``fx`` -- whose spread is ``F P F^T``, without the ``Q`` that predict
added analytically. The innovation covariance was therefore short by
``H Q H^T`` -- OD-10, inherited from the library rather than introduced by the
port, and pinned here so that changing it had to be a decision.

**It was changed on 15 August 2026 (ADR-0032)**, and this is the one place the
port deliberately departs from FilterPy. ``predict`` now redraws the sigma
points from the ``Q``-inflated covariance, so the update observes a set whose
spread is the full predicted covariance. Measured in the closed loop, the old
statistic was inflated **1.34x at the median** and **1.02x at the largest single
distance** -- the correction is largest where innovations are small and nearly
absent in the tail, which is where vetoes are decided (E-147).

**Against the recorded numbers**, in the benchmarks. E-68 records that the fault
study and the comparison harness reproduce every figure they produced under
FilterPy, which is the check that matters for the evidence pack.

What is deliberately not asserted
----------------------------------
Bit-identity with FilterPy. It is not reachable: FilterPy factors covariance
with SciPy's upper-triangular Cholesky and this uses NumPy's lower-triangular
one, and the two LAPACK paths round differently in the last places. Measured
over 2,000 predict/update steps the state agrees to **6e-10** and the covariance
to **1e-14** -- and eliminating even that would mean keeping SciPy, which is the
dependency being removed. What matters is whether the difference changes a
decision, and E-68 measures that it does not.

    ``H Q H^T``. That was FilterPy's behaviour, reproducing it was deliberate
    (see the module docstring), and it was pinned so that changing it *"has to
    be a decision rather than a drift"*.

    It became a decision. ADR-0032 redraws the sigma points from the
    ``Q``-inflated covariance at the end of :meth:`predict`, and this test now
    asserts the textbook identity. The old expectation is kept below as the

    read as a passing test with one assertion quietly deleted.

    Both directions are asserted for the same reason the OD-18 tests assert
