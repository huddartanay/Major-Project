"""The soak harness's judgement, tested against runs it should and should not pass.

The harness is the instrument that decides whether the closed loop is stable
over long runs, and an instrument that reports stability whatever it is shown is
worse than no instrument -- it converts an unknown into a false assurance. So
every criterion here is exercised twice: once with a series that should pass it
and once with a series constructed to break exactly that one.

``benchmarks/`` is deliberately not an installable package; the repository root
is on ``pythonpath`` for the same reason the integration tests can import
``training``.
