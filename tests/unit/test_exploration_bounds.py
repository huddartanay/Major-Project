"""Does bounded safe exploration actually keep the vehicle moving, and bounded?

The claim these tests exist to hold up
----------------------------------------
From the tunnel scenario's own docstring, and it is the architecture's
distinguishing sentence:

    *"Those degrade to a halt when they leave their certified envelope. ASTRA is
    built not to: with no admissible profile, RCM engages bounded safe
    exploration ... and the vehicle continues."*

Two promises. **It continues**, and it continues **inside a bound**. On
10 August 2026 neither held, for two separate reasons, and each was hiding the
other.

OD-12 -- it did not continue
------------------------------
On a platform the twin was never fitted to, the twin mispredicts, so L6 and L7b
veto. L9 sees no matching profile and declares ``SAFE_EXPLORATION``. L8 counts
those same vetoes, escalates through DEGRADED and LIMP, and reaches HALT --
which is terminal. Measured: **520 ticks in exploration, 305 of them vetoed,
counter 0 -> 100, HALT first reached at t458 while RCM was still saying
SAFE_EXPLORATION.**

Two layers answering "are we outside our envelope?" and acting in contradiction.
The vetoes L8 counted were *the definition* of the condition L9 had already
detected, declared and responded to -- one event escalated twice, and the
terminal answer won.

The fix conditions on **posture, not gate identity**, because L8's own docstring
forbids the latter: *"which gate vetoed is evidence for the log, not an input to
the escalation policy ... which SI-3 forbids."* So the counter freezes while
exploration is engaged. **Veto authority is untouched** -- every gate still
vetoes and every veto still stops the command reaching an actuator.

OD-13 -- it was not bounded
-----------------------------
Fixing OD-12 exposed the second defect immediately. ``exploration_envelope``
computes ``speed_cap = nearest_certified_max * 0.5``; ``restricted_space`` turns
the envelope into *narrowed channel bounds*, which limits how much throttle may
be commanded on one tick and bounds the resulting speed not at all. Given enough
ticks at reduced throttle the vehicle still accelerates.

Measured on a weak-braking platform: exploring for all 600 ticks while
accelerating monotonically to **23.10 m/s**, above the calibrated baseline's
12.54, with **zero** deterministic-shield vetoes. The envelope computed a cap
and enforced it against nothing.

The cap now flows through the same projector seam P2.1 built for the fail-safe
cap -- the one that made ``SPEED_CAPPED`` mean a command the cap *altered*.
