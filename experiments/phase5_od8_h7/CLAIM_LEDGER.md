| The legacy L6 corpus was not exchangeable with live scores | **Established** | E18 diagnostic | **Yes** |
| OD-8 miscalibration is a calibration-set provenance failure, not a threshold value | **Established** | E18: global recalibration reproduces the defect | **Yes** |
| ~~OD-8 provides operational monitoring under specified policy constraints (P1 only)~~ | **WITHDRAWN** | E18-R1: on the matched evaluation window P1 is 4/30 runs in band, median run FAR 0.00 % | **No** |
| OD-8 is calibrated for any policy on the evaluation window | **Not established** | E18-R1: P1 4/30, P3 5/30 (E18 matched); P3 9/30 (R1) | **No** |
| E18 measured false-alarm rate and detection on different tick windows | **Established** | E18-R1 audit | **Yes** |

| Matched-window calibration recovers P1 | **Rejected** | E18-R2: 13/30, below the frozen 24/30 bar | **No** |
| ~~The current OD-8 formulation cannot deliver per-run-stable false alarms at eps=0.05~~ | **SUPERSEDED** | E18-R3: the qualifier *on 200-tick windows* was load-bearing. At n=3200 (160 s) P1 reaches 30/30 | **No — use the row below** |
| **OD-8 delivers per-run-stable clean-data behaviour on P1 at a 160-second evaluation window** | **Established** | E18-R3: 30/30 runs in band, frozen threshold, held-out seeds, no drift | **Yes, with the window stated** |
| **The P1 instability was precision-limited, not dynamics-limited** | **Established** | E18-R3: FAR variability falls with window length; 12/30 → 30/30 | **Yes** |
| **P3's residual failure is threshold bias, not instability** | **Supported** | E18-R3: variance collapses (slope −0.918) but median FAR converges to 1.16 %, below the 2.5 % floor | **Yes** |
| ~~OD-8 detects 4 of 6 faults at a 160-second window on P1~~ | **SUPERSEDED** | E18-R3c: under *sustained* injection only 3 of 6 are detected. R3b's fourth (`imu_dropout`) was aftermath-only | **No — use the rows below** |
| **OD-8 detects 3 of 6 faults on P1 under sustained fault at a 160-second window** | **Established** | E18-R3c: `position_bias` 100 %, `position_drift` 100 %, `lateral_noise` 100 %; `speed_stuck` 37 %, `speed_bias` 0 %, `imu_dropout` 0 % | **Yes, with window and injection mode stated** |
| **A persistent sensor failure is invisible to the monitor for as long as it persists** | **Established** | E18-R3c: sustained `imu_dropout`, 160 s, 30 seeds, alarm rate 0.2 % — *below* the ~5 % clean baseline in every phase | **Yes — the safety-critical finding** |
| **`imu_dropout` detection is aftermath-only** | **Established** | E18-R3b 99.1 % vs E18-R3c 0.2 % on identical seeds and threshold; the only difference is whether the fault ends | **Yes** |
| **`lateral_noise` is genuinely sustained-detectable** | **Established** | E18-R3c late phases 0.977 / 1.000 / 1.000, exceeding R3b throughout | **Yes** |
| **Alarm suppression under sustained failure** | **Established** | E18-R3c: fault alarm rate below clean baseline for 160 s continuously, 30 seeds, phase-resolved | **Yes** |
| Longer windows improve detection by statistical power | **Refuted** | E18-R3b/R3c: no accumulation-driven detection observed under sustained fault | **No** |
| Longer windows improve detection by covering the recovery transient | **Established** | E18-R3b vs R3c: aftermath 99.1 %, sustained 0.2 %, same fault | **Yes, restricted to faults that end** |
| R3b's `position_drift` result was inflated by a drift-scaling defect | **Established** | `span` computed from the `TICKS=400` constant but applied over 3,400 ticks, reaching ~32 m instead of 2 m. R3c corrects it | **Yes, correction recorded** |
| `speed_bias` and `speed_stuck` are detectable at any window in any injection mode | **Rejected** | E18-R3b and R3c: scores flat in every phase, neither transient nor sustained recovers them | **No** |
| **P1's limit is within-run alarm clustering** | **Established** | lag-1 autocorr +0.359; 4.2x overdispersion; 11 effective ticks | **Yes** |
| **P3's limit is between-run baseline variation** | **Established** | lag-1 autocorr ~0; 9.2x overdispersion; 2 effective ticks | **Yes** |
| OD-8 is calibrated for P2 | **Rejected** | E18: 0/30 runs in band, drift/SD 1.28 | **No** |
| **`D_s` does not predict operational detection** | **Established** | E18, 17/28 cells disagree; D_L6 rho +0.29 (p=0.14) | **Yes** |
| **Higher sensor-level `D_L1` is associated with *lower* operational detection** | **Supported** | E18, Spearman rho = -0.480, p = 0.0088, n = 28 cells | **Yes, as an association** |
| **Fault-induced alarm suppression** | **Supported** | E18, 11/28 cells on valid policies, all p < 0.05 | **Yes, as observed** |
| **`D_s` does not predict operational detection** — second, independent confirmation | **Established** | Phase 2: rho = 0.077, p = 0.7192, n = 24 cells. Unlike the primary M test this has no algebraic relationship to the outcome | **Yes** |
| A per-fault metric can represent phase-dependent detection | **Refuted** | Phase 2: `position_drift` runs 0.068 -> 1.000 across four phases at a constant `D_s` of 0.997 | **No** |
| **Monitorability M(f,p) predicts operational detection** | **Weak** | Phase 2: identity-free rho = 0.654, p = 0.0113 on 15 cells. The pre-registered primary (rho = 0.895) is inflated by an identity between the metric and its outcome | **Yes, at "weak", and only with the identity disclosed** |
| ~~The location-only monitorability metric is fit for ASTRA 2.0~~ | **WITHDRAWN** | Phase 2: M reads sustained `imu_dropout` as mildly elevated above clean in every phase, while the monitor runs 25x quieter than its own clean baseline. A location statistic cannot represent a dispersion failure | **No** |
| A dispersion-augmented monitorability metric would work | **Not tested** | Phase 2 generated this hypothesis and did not test it. Its definition would now be chosen after seeing results, so it needs a fresh pre-registration | **No** |
| `speed_stuck` and `imu_dropout` are undetectable by OD-8 under sustained fault | **Established** | E18-R3c: `imu_dropout` 0 %, `speed_stuck` 37 %, both below the 90 % criterion. R3b's `imu_dropout` 100 % was aftermath, not sustained detection | **Yes, with injection mode stated** |
| General L2a absorption | **Withdrawn** | E17 + E17-Position | **No** |
| Position faults are absorbed at L2a | **Withdrawn** | E17-Position, 0 of 12 cells | **No** |
| "Information is destroyed at L2a" | **Withdrawn** | the L6 statistic recovers part of it | **No** |
| L6 detection-without-response gap | **Withdrawn** | gate returns PASS on every tick | **No** |
| H-regime (veto rate as an operating-regime covariate) | **Withdrawn** | Simpson's paradox; veto rate is an OD-8 readout | **No** |
| `D_L2a > D_L1` under one-liar conditions | **Preliminary** | E17-Position R1, one condition | **Only as preliminary** |
| H7 monitor placement works | **Not tested** | E19 | **No** |
| Lying-sensor detection | **Not tested** | E20 | **No** |

## Terminology rules

- `D = 0.5` is **chance-level discriminability**, never "50 % accuracy".
- High `D` does **not** imply an operational gate fired. E18 measured this directly.
- Alarm suppression is **not** "better detection". It is a fault reducing the monitor's alarm rate
  below its clean baseline.
- Preferred phrasing for a collapse: *"the evaluated representation does not retain discriminative
  evidence"*. Never *"information is destroyed"*.
- The stage vector is the **fault observability profile**. `A(f)` is reported only where the profile
  crosses the absorption threshold at most once.
- A statistic is called "accuracy" only if it is classification accuracy.
- **OD-8 claims must state the evaluation window.** E18-R3 showed the window was the binding
  variable, so a claim without it is meaningless. The permitted form is:
  *"OD-8 provides operationally stable clean-data behaviour on P1 at a 160-second evaluation
  window."* Any claim about **detection** at that window is **not yet permitted** — R3 measured
  false alarms only.
- A false-alarm rate and a detection rate quoted together **must** be computed over the same tick
  range, and that range must be named in the pre-registration.
- **Detection must be reported phase-resolved** — during-fault and post-fault separately. E18-R3b
  showed a fault that is undetectable during its own duration and near-certain afterwards;
  a window-aggregate detection rate hides that completely and would be misleading.
- **Detection claims must state the injection mode** — transient (fault ends) or sustained
  (fault persists). E18-R3c showed the same fault at 99.1 % transient and 0.2 % sustained.
  A detection rate without the mode is not interpretable.

- **Monitorability must be quoted per (fault, phase), never per fault** — Phase 2: `position_drift`
  moves 0.068 -> 1.000 across phases while `D_s` stays at 0.997. A per-fault number cannot
  represent the quantity it is being scored against.
- **Any metric scored against detection must be checked for an algebraic path to it** — Phase 2's
  pre-registered primary reached rho = 0.895 largely because `median > threshold` and
  `alarm rate > 0.5` are the same statement. The confound was in the frozen definition, not in the
  data, and it was only visible because the identity was looked for after the number arrived.
